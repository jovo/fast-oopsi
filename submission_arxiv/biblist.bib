  abstract = {The inferior colliculus is a central auditory structure which serves
	
	as a site for the integration of ascending and descending auditory
	
	information. Changes in central auditory structures may occur with
	
	acoustic exposure, which cannot be explained by alterations in cochlear
	
	function alone. Rats were exposed to a 10-kHz tone at 100 dB SPL
	
	for 9 h. Auditory brainstem response measures showed an initial 25-30-dB
	
	threshold shift across all tested frequencies. By 30 days post-exposure,
	
	thresholds for clicks and most frequencies returned to near control
	
	levels; however, thresholds remained elevated at 10 and 20 kHz. Inner
	
	hair cell loss was confined to apical and basal ends of the cochlea,
	
	and did not exceed 20\%. Inferior colliculus levels of the two isoforms
	
	of the GABA synthetic enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (65,000 and
	
	67,000 mol. wt forms) were measured immediately post-exposure (0
	
	h) and at two and 30 days post-exposure using quantitative immunocytochemical
	
	and western blotting techniques. Zero-hour measures revealed a significant
	
	increase in the level of glutamate decarboxylase (mol. wt 67,000)
	
	protein (118\%), as well as in the optical density (35\%) of immunolabeled
	
	cells. By 30 days post-exposure, inferior colliculus protein levels
	
	of both glutamate decarboxylase isoforms were significantly below
	
	unexposed controls (39\% and 21\% for the 65,000 and 67,000 mol.
	
	wt forms, respectively). These studies describe increased markers
	
	for GABA immediately following acoustic exposure, followed by a decline
	
	to below control levels from two to 30 days post-exposure. It remains
	
	to be determined whether noise trauma-induced changes in glutamate
	
	decarboxylase levels in the inferior colliculus reflect protective
	
	up-regulation in response to intense stimulation, followed by the
	
	establishment of new neurotransmitter equilibrium levels.},

  abstract = {Neural networks are composed of basic units somewhat analogous to

	strength is modifiable as a result of a learning process or algorithm.
	Each of these units integrates independently (in parallel) the information
	provided by its synapses in order to evaluate its state of activation.
	The unit response is then a linear or nonlinear function of its activation.
	Linear algebra concepts are used, in general, to analyze linear units,
	with eigenvectirs and eigenvalues being the core concepts involved.
	This analysis makes clear the strong similarite between linear neural
	networks and the general linear model developed by statisticians.
	The linar models presented here are the perceptron, and the linear
	associator. The behavior of nonlinear networks can be described within
	the framework of optimization and approximation techniques with dynamical
	systems (e.g., like those used to model spin glasses). One of the
	main notions used with nonlinear unit networks is the notioon of
	attractor. When the task of the network is to associate a response
	with some specific input patterns, the most popular nonlinear technique
	consists of using hidden layers of neurons trained with back-propagation
	of error. The nonlinear models presented are the Hopfield network,
	the Boltzmann machine, the back-propagation network, and the radial
	basis function network.},

  abstract = {Accreting Black Holes (BHs) are believed to be sites of possible particle
	acceleration with favorable conditions also for effective gamma-ray
	production. However, because of photon-photon pair production, only
	low energy (MeV) gamma-rays can escape these compact objects with
	typically very large compactness parameter, Îº = L/LEdd*Rg/Râ‰¥ 0.01,
	given that in most cases the accretion disks within 10 Schwarzschild
	radii Rg radiate with a power exceeding 10 percent of the Eddington
	luminosity, LEdd. Therefore the high energy gamma-ray emission of
	these objects (both of stellar mass and super-massive BHs) is generally
	suppressed, and consequently the unique information on possible particle
	acceleration processes near the event horizon of the BH is essentially
	lost. Fortunately this is not the case for the super-massive BH located
	at the dynamical center of our Galaxy (Sgr A*), which thanks to its
	extraordinary low bolometric luminosity (â‰¤ 10âˆ’8LEdd) is transparent
	for gamma-rays up to very high energies, E âˆ¼ 10 TeV. We discuss
	different scenarios of gamma-ray production in Sgr A*, and show that
	for a reasonable set of parameters one can expect detectable gamma-ray
	fluxes of both hadronic and electronic origin. Some of these scenarios
	are applicable not only for the TeV gamma-ray emission recently reported
	from the direction of Galactic Center, but may have broader implications
	relevant to highly variable nonthermal emission of Sgr A* in radio,
	IR and X-ray bands.},

  abstract = {The organization of CA1 projections to the rat subiculum was investigated
	with the anterograde tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L).
	Discrete iontophoretic injections of PHA-L were placed into various
	transverse positions of the CA1 field at different septotemporal
	levels of the hippocampus. The distribution of CA1 projections was
	observed in dissected and extended hippocampal preparations. CA1
	cells located proximally in the field, i.e., close to the CA2 field,
	gave rise to projections that terminated in the distal third of the
	subiculum, i.e., close to the presubiculum. CA1 cells located distally
	in the field, i.e., close to the subiculum, gave rise to projections
	that terminated proximally in the subiculum, i.e., just across the
	CA1/subiculum border. CA1 cells in the middle of the field projected
	to a midtransverse portion of the subiculum. The same general pattern
	of projections was observed at all septotemporal levels of the hippocampus.
	Varicose fibers from the CA1 neurons terminated among the basal dendrites
	of the subicular pyramidal cells, within the pyramidal cell layer,
	and in the deep portion of the molecular layer. In addition to the
	CA1 to subiculum projections, the discrete PHA-L injections provided
	the opportunity of examining the extent of local and associational
	connections within CA1. In general, associational connections in
	CA1 are far less extensive than in CA3. CA1 is not entirely without
	local connections, however. CA1 cells located close to the subicular
	border, for example, originated axons that first innervated the proximal
	subiculum and then reentered the CA1 field at the interface between
	stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum-moleculare. In most of the
	experimental cases, there were collaterals located in stratum oriens
	of CA1 that branched from the fibers directed toward the subiculum.
	Thus, the basal dendrites of CA1 cells may receive associational
	inputs. The organization of the CA1 projections to the subiculum
	is discussed in relation to the organization of CA3 projections to
	CA1 and the differential output of transverse regions of the subiculum.
	The possibility is raised that information may be "channeled" through
	the hippocampal formation via the transverse organization of these
	connections and ultimately distributed to different recipients of
	hippocampal efferent projections.},

	convolutive signal superposition, in contrast with the commonly used
	instantaneous mixing model. In the frequency-domain, convolutive
	mixing is equivalent to multiplicative mixing of complex signal sources
	within distinct spectral bands. We decompose the recorded spectraldomain
	signals into independent components by a complex infomax ICA algorithm.
	First results from a visual attention EEG experiment exhibit: (1)
	sources of spatio-temporal dynamics in the data, (2) links to subject
	behavior, (3) sources with a limited spectral extent, and (4) a higher
	degree of independence compared to sources derived by standard ICA.},

	In this review we summarize this development and discuss similarities

	its possible relevance for chiral phase transition in QCD and color

	formation and pair condensation in strong - coupling and low carrier
	density superconductors (i.e. the formation of the pseudogap phase
	). Second part is a review of nonlinear sigma model approach to an
	analogous phenomenon in the Chiral Gross-Neveu model at small N.
	In the third section we discuss the modified NambuÂ–Jona- Lasinio
	model where the chiral phase transition is accompanied by a formation

  abstract = {Many areas of biology and biotechnology have been revolutionized by
	
	the ability to label proteins genetically by fusion to the Aequorea
	
	green fluorescent protein (GFP). In previous fusions, the GFP has
	
	been treated as an indivisible entity, usually appended to the amino
	
	or carboxyl terminus of the host protein, occasionally inserted within
	
	the host sequence. The tightly interwoven, three-dimensional structure
	
	and intricate posttranslational self-modification required for chromophore
	
	formation would suggest that major rearrangements or insertions within
	
	GFP would prevent fluorescence. However, we now show that several
	
	rearrangements of GFPs, in which the amino and carboxyl portions
	
	are interchanged and rejoined with a short spacer connecting the
	
	original termini, still become fluorescent. These circular permutations
	
	have altered pKa values and orientations of the chromophore with
	
	respect to a fusion partner. Furthermore, certain locations within
	
	GFP tolerate insertion of entire proteins, and conformational changes
	
	in the insert can have profound effects on the fluorescence. For
	
	example, insertions of calmodulin or a zinc finger domain in place
	
	of Tyr-145 of a yellow mutant (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein)
	
	of GFP result in indicator proteins whose fluorescence can be enhanced
	
	severalfold upon metal binding. The calmodulin graft into enhanced
	
	yellow fluorescent protein can monitor cytosolic {Ca}$^{2+}$ in single
	
	mammalian cells. The tolerance of GFPs for circular permutations
	
	and insertions shows the folding process is surprisingly robust and
	
	offers a new strategy for creating genetically encodable, physiological

  note = {This rather vague paper draws picture of mathematical visual information
	processing pathway in brain as the author sees it.},
  abstract = {Cooperative processes, or algorithms, are procedures that generate
	large-scale, or global, effects through sequences of small-scale,
	or local, operations. Such procedures underlie life as we know it.
	They are encountered in a variety of physical and chemical systems,
	and are found in biological systems at all levels of organization.
	In a cooperative system, global computations are performed by many
	units operating in parallel. Cooperativity emerges in these systems
	through interactions among component units. Each unit generates a
	new state from its previous one by combining information available
	internally with signals received from neighboring units and from
	outside. This article considers cooperativity and parallelism in
	two classes of mathematical models of brain function developed by
	researchers in the field over the past 10 to 15 years. The human
	brain, containing approximately 1011 neurons and perhaps as many
	as 1015 distinct synaptic connections, is the archetype of a highly
	cooperative, massively parallel system. The first class of models
	and accompanying solution methods were constructed to carry out tasks
	in perceptual inferencing, such as the segmentation of a scene into
	its component surfaces, figureÂ–ground segregation, and object recognition.
	In these computer-based approaches we construct a Markov random field
	(MRF) to capture correlations in a visual image and then use simulated
	annealing, or one of its siblings, to generate sequences of small
	changes. The solution methods are stochastic in character; the computations
	are intrinsically parallel and are inspired by our thinking about
	how the early stages of visual processing might occur in the brain.
	The second class of mathematical models and methods has as its central
	theme the notion of assembly coding. These models and methods were
	developed to carry out the same tasks as those in the first class,
	but we now construct families of coupled first-order ordinary differential
	equations that describe circuits of interconnected neurons. We then
	evolve these nonlinear dynamical systems through sequences of states
	that converge to fixed points, limit cycles, or chaotic attractors.
	The solution methods can be either deterministic or stochastic; the
	computations are parallel and highly distributed, and they model
	circuits found in the mammalian brain.},

  abstract = {This investigation attempted to determine the mode of distribution
	
	and synaptic targets of the cartwheel cell axon in the guinea pig
	
	dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCoN). Antiserum against PEP-19, a putative
	
	calcium-binding neuropeptide, was employed at the light and electron
	
	microscopic levels. We show that in the hind-brain of the guinea
	
	pig, cerebellar Purkinje cells and DCoN cartwheel cells are the most
	
	densely immunoreactive neurons. The PEP-19 immunoreaction product
	
	is localized to all neuronal compartments of these cells. Primary
	
	targets of cartwheel cell axons are the DCoN pyramidal cells, the
	
	large efferent neurons of layer 2. These neurons receive numerous
	
	immunoreactive synaptic boutons on their cell bodies and apical and
	
	basal dendritic arbors. A PEP-19-immunoreactive axonal plexus, largely
	
	formed by cartwheel cell axons, highlights layer 3, co-extensively
	
	with the basal arbors of pyramidal cells. This plexus is oriented
	
	predominantly in the transstrial plane of the DCoN, in parallel with
	
	the sheet-like basal dendritic arbor of pyramidal neurons and with
	
	the isofrequency bands of primary cochlear nerve fibers. PEP-19-positive
	
	boutons contain pleomorphic synaptic vesicles and form symmetric
	
	synaptic junctions, indicative of inhibitory innervation. In addition,
	
	immunoreactive boutons, similar to those synapsing on pyramidal neurons,
	
	were observed on the cell bodies and main dendritic trunks of cartwheel
	
	neurons, indicating a system of recurrent collaterals. Furthermore,
	
	a small number of PEP-19-positive axons of unknown origin reach the
	
	caudal rim of the posteroventral cochlear nucleus. Within the territory
	
	of distribution of the cartwheel cell axon are the dendrites of at
	
	least two other types of DCoN neuron, the vertical cells of Lorente
	
	de N� and the giant cells. These neurons may represent additional
	
	targets of the cartwheel cell axon, but this remains to be ascertained
	
	with specific methods. Our data demonstrate that the cartwheel neurons
	
	modulate the activity of pyramidal neurons and, therefore, play a
	
	key role in shaping the output of the DCoN superficial layers.},

	},
  abstract = {Molecular profiling studies can generate abundance measurements for
	thousands of transcripts, proteins, metabolites, or other species
	in, for example, normal and tumor tissue samples. Treating such measurements
	as features and the samples as labeled data points, sparse hyperplanes
	provide a statistical methodology for classifying data points into
	one of two categories (classification and prediction) and defining
	a small subset of discriminatory features (relevant feature identification).
	However, this and other extant classification methods address only
	implicitly the issue of observed data being a combination of underlying
	signals and noise. Recently, robust optimization has emerged as a
	powerful framework for handling uncertain data explicitly. Here,
	ideas from this field are exploited to develop robust sparse hyperplanes,
	i.e., classification and relevant feature identification algorithms
	that are resilient to variation in the data. Specifically, each data
	point is associated with an explicit data uncertainty model in the
	form of an ellipsoid parameterized by a center and covariance matrix.
	The task of learning a robust sparse hyperplane from such data is
	formulated as a second order cone program (SOCP). Gaussian and distribution-free
	data uncertainty models are shown to yield SOCPs that are equivalent
	to the SCOP based on ellipsoidal uncertainty. The real-world utility
	of robust sparse hyperplanes is demonstrated via retrospective analysis
	of breast cancer related transcript profiles. Data-dependent heuristics
	are used to compute the parameters of each ellipsoidal data uncertainty
	model. The generalization performance of a specific implementation,
	designated ï¾“robust Liknon,ï¾” is better than its nominal counterpart.
	Finally, the strengths and limitations of robust sparse hyperplanes
	are discussed.},

	RNAi. Despite developments in using chemical modifications for increased
	stability, safety, and efficiency of these therapeutics, they still
	face challenges of spatial and temporal targeting. One potential
	targeting strategy is to use photocaging techniques, which involve
	the covalent attachment of photolabile compounds to the effector
	nucleic acid species that block bioactivity until exposed to near
	UV light. In this study we demonstrate that fully 2'-fluorinated
	nucleic acids (FNAs) can be caged for photoactivated gene silencing
	in cell culture and in zebrafish embryos. This strategy combines
	the improvement in chemical and enzymatic stability associated with
	2'-substitutions with the targeting ability of a photoinducible trigger.
	Statistical alkylation of FNAs with 1-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrophenyl)diazoethane
	(DMNPE) improved resistance to enzymatic degradation, reduced RNAi
	effectiveness, and protected the biological system from toxic doses
	of the effector. Photo-exposure to 365 nm light partially restored
	the silencing activity of the 2'-fluoro siRNAs. These results suggest
	that photocaging may offer control over RNAi therapeutics for spatially
	and temporally directed activation, while improving enzymatic stability
	and potentially enabling therapeutic dosing via light dose intensity.},

	magnocellularis (NM) and nucleus laminaris of young animals are dramatically
	
	altered by changes in the auditory receptor. We examined the role
	
	of presynaptic activity on these transneuronal regulatory events.
	
	TTX was used to block action potentials in the auditory nerve. TTX
	
	injections into the perilymph reliably blocked all neuronal activity
	
	in the cochlear nerve and NM. Far-field recordings of sound-evoked
	
	potentials revealed that responses returned within 6-12 hr after
	
	a single TTX injection. Changes in protein synthesis by NM neurons
	
	were measured by determining the incorporation of 3H-leucine using
	
	autoradiography. NM neurons on the side of the brain ipsilateral
	
	to the TTX injection were compared to normally active cells on the
	
	other side of the same tissue section. Grain counts over individual
	
	neurons revealed that a single injection of TTX produced a 40\% decrease
	
	in grain density in ipsilateral NM neurons within 1.5 hr after the
	
	TTX injection. However, by 24 hr after a single TTX injection, grain
	
	densities were not different on the 2 sides of the brain. Continuous
	
	activity blockade for 6 hr caused the cessation of amino acid incorporation
	
	in a portion of NM neurons and a 15-20\% decrease in the remaining
	
	neurons. These changes in amino acid incorporation are comparable
	
	to those following complete removal of the cochlea (Steward and Rubel,
	
	1985). We also examined NM for neuron loss and soma shrinkage after
	
	blocking eighth nerve action potentials. TTX injected every 12 hr
	
	for 48 hr caused a 20\% neuron loss and an 8\% shrinkage of the remaining
	
	neurons. Similar reductions were found following cochlea removal
	
	(Born and Rubel, 1985). It is concluded that neuronal activity plays
	
	a major role in the maintenance of normal NM neurons. Furthermore,
	
	these results suggest that transneuronal morphological changes seen
	
	in neurons following deafferentation or alterations of sensory experience
	
	are a result of changes in the level of presynaptic activity.},

  abstract = {Activity-dependent elevation of calcium within presynaptic boutons
	
	regulates many aspects of synaptic transmission. Here, we examine
	
	presynaptic residual calcium (Ca(res)) transients in individual presynaptic
	
	boutons of cerebellar granule cells at near-physiological temperatures
	
	using two-photon microscopy. Properties of Ca(res) under conditions
	
	of zero-added buffer were determined by measuring Ca(res) transients
	
	while loading boutons to a steady-state indicator concentration.
	
	These experiments revealed that, in the absence of exogenous calcium
	
	buffers, a single action potential evokes transients of Ca(res) that
	
	vary widely in different boutons both in amplitude (400-900 nM) and
	
	time course (25-55 ms). Variation in calcium influx density, endogenous
	
	buffer capacity, and calcium extrusion density contribute to differences
	
	in Ca(res) among boutons. Heterogeneity in Ca(res) within different
	
	boutons suggests that plasticity can be regulated independently at
	
	different synapses arising from an individual granule cell. In a
	
	given bouton, Ca(res) signals were highly reproducible from trial
	
	to trial and failures of calcium influx were not observed. We find
	
	that a factor contributing to this reliability is that an action
	
	potential opens a large number of calcium channels (20-125) in a
	
	bouton. Presynaptic calcium signals were also used to assess the
	
	ability of granule cell axons to convey somatically generated action
	
	potentials to distant synapses. In response to pairs of action potentials
	
	or trains, granule cell boutons showed a remarkable ability to respond
	
	reliably at frequencies up to 500 Hz. Thus, individual boutons appear
	
	specialized for reliable calcium signaling during bursts of high-frequency
	
	activation such as those that are observed in vivo.},

	composite systems in quantum field theory is the light-front Fock
	expansion which encodes the properties of a hadrons in terms of a
	set of frame-independent n-particle wavefunctions. Light-front quantization
	in the doubly-transverse light-cone gauge has a number of remarkable
	advantages, including explicit unitarity, a physical Fock expansion,
	the absence of ghost degrees of freedom, and the decoupling properties
	needed to prove factorization theorems in high momentum transfer
	inclusive and exclusive reactions. A number of applications are discussed
	in these lectures, including semileptonic B decays, two-photon exclusive
	reactions, diffractive dissociation into jets, and deeply virtual
	Compton scattering. The relation of the intrinsic sea to the light-front
	wavefunctions is discussed. Light-front quantization can also be
	used in the Hamiltonian form to construct an event generator for
	high energy physics reactions at the amplitude level. The light-cone
	partition function, summed over exponentiallyweighted light-cone
	energies, has simple boost properties which may be useful for studies
	in heavy ion collisions. I also review recent work which shows that
	the structure functions measured in deep inelastic lepton scattering
	are affected by final-state rescattering, thus modifying their connection
	to light-front probability distributions. In particular, the shadowing
	of nuclear structure functions is due to destructive interference
	effects from leading-twist diffraction of the virtual photon, physics
	not included in the nuclear light-cone wavefunctions.},

	The efficiency of antipsychotic drugs, particularly of typical antipsychotics,
	on cognitive deficit in schizophrenia remains disputable. Inhibition
	of serotonin (5-HT) 2A/2C receptors is important for cognitive improvement
	in schizophrenic patients treated with antipsychotics. The aim of
	the present work was to establish the effect of the 5-HT2A/2C receptor
	antagonist ritanserin (2.5 or 5 mg/kg), the dopamine D2 antagonist
	haloperidol (0.1 or 1 mg/kg), and the atypical antipsychotic risperidone
	(0.1 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg), which is an antagonist of both 5-HT2A/2C
	and D2 receptors, on cognitive deficit induced by subchronic administration
	of dizocilpine (MK-801, 0.1 mg/kg). We used the active allothetic
	place avoidance (AAPA) task, requiring the rat to differentiate between
	relevant and irrelevant stimuli, in a way similar to disruption of
	information processing disturbed in schizophrenic patients. Our results
	show that treatment with 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonists, regardless
	of their effect on D2 receptors, blocked the cognitive impairment
	produced by MK-801. Haloperidol did not sufficiently reduce the deficit
	in AAPA induced by MK-801. Interestingly, administration of risperidone
	and haloperidol alone, but not ritanserin, impaired the AAPA performance
	in intact rats. Ritanserin and risperidone actually improve cognition
	independently of their effect on locomotor activity in an animal
	model of schizophrenia-like behavior. This finding is in accordance
	with the assumption that some antipsychotics are primarily effective
	against cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We hypothesised that different solutions for submucosal
	injection may influence early healing of endoscopic mucosal resection
	(EMR). The aim of this study was to evaluate histological and immunological
	changes after EMR in experimental pigs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two
	parallel EMRs on the anterior and posterior wall of the gastric body
	were performed by means of the cap technique in 21 female pigs. A
	glycerol-based solution (anterior EMR) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose
	solution (posterior EMR) were applied for submucosal injection. The
	animals were sacrificed 7 days later, and tissue sections of all
	EMRs were stained using combined trichrome. Computer image analysis
	was used for objective evaluation of elastic and collagen fibres
	content. Two-colour indirect immunophenotyping of blood and gastric
	samples were performed using mouse anti-pig monoclonal antibodies.
	RESULTS: The values of collagen fibre content 7 days after EMR were
	significantly higher in lesions after the use of solution A in comparison
	with solution B (2.10 +/- 0.25\% versus 1.57 +/- 0.25\%, p = 0.009).
	Concordant results were found in elastic fibres (3.23 +/- 0.49\%
	versus 2.93 +/- 0.61\%, p = 0.018). No systemic changes in major
	leukocyte subpopulations were found. In gastric tissue, lymphocyte
	subsets exhibited only minor changes. CD4(+) T-lymphocytes were increased
	in the healing tissue after EMR using solution A (17.08 +/- 9.24\%
	versus 9.76 +/- 7.97\%, p = 0.011). Significant increase of SWC3(+)
	leukocytes was observed after EMR using solution B (47.70 +/- 25.41\%
	versus 18.70 +/- 12.16\%, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The use of glycerol-based
	solution for submucosal injection was associated with more pronounced
	histological signs of early healing of EMRs compared with hydroxypropyl

  abstract = {Book Description
	
	
	The second edition of this book is unique in that it focuses on methods
	
	for making formal statistical inference from all the models in an
	
	a priori set (Multi-Model Inference). A philosophy is presented for
	
	model-based data analysis and a general strategy outlined for the
	
	analysis of empirical data. The book invites increased attention
	
	on a priori science hypotheses and modeling. Kullback-Leibler Information
	
	represents a fundamental quantity in science and is Hirotugu Akaike's
	
	basis for model selection. The maximized log-likelihood function
	
	can be bias-corrected as an estimator of expected, relative Kullback-Leibler
	
	information. This leads to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and
	
	various extensions. These methods are relatively simple and easy
	
	to use in practice, but based on deep statistical theory. The information
	
	theoretic approaches provide a unified and rigorous theory, an extension
	
	of likelihood theory, an important application of information theory,
	
	and are objective and practical to employ across a very wide class
	
	of empirical problems. The book presents several new ways to incorporate
	
	model selection uncertainty into parameter estimates and estimates
	
	of precision. An array of challenging examples is given to illustrate
	
	various technical issues. This is an applied book written primarily
	
	for biologists and statisticians wanting to make inferences from
	
	multiple models and is suitable as a graduate text or as a reference
	
	for professional analysts.

	in sagittal slices from the cerebellar vermis. Sharp microelectrode
	
	recordings from the soma or dendrites were combined with high-speed
	
	fluorescence imaging of intracellularly injected fura-2. In this
	
	way both the electrical responses and the associated [{Ca}$^{2+}$]$_i$
	
	changes could be monitored at the same time. Usually simultaneously
	
	activated inhibition caused almost no change to the somatically recorded
	
	CF response. However, the inhibition caused a strong reduction in
	
	the CF-associated [{Ca}$^{2+}$]$_i$ increase which normally was widespread
	
	in the dendrites. This effect was graded; stronger inhibition caused
	
	a larger and more widespread reduction in the [{Ca}$^{2+}$]$_i$ change
	
	that was greatest in the more distal dendrites. Sometimes the reduction
	
	was over 90\% in the distal dendrites and occasionally it was localized
	
	to only a single dendritic branch. Both the inhibitory postsynaptic
	
	potential (IPSP) and the associated reduction in the CF-induced [{Ca}$^{2+}$]$_i$
	
	change were blocked by bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist.
	
	Dendritic recordings showed that each CF response evoked a 2-3 msec
	
	wide action potential. The amplitude of this action potential was
	
	reduced in a graded manner by the IPSP in parallel with the reduction
	
	in the [{Ca}$^{2+}$]$_i$ change. Varying the time between the activation
	
	of the IPSP and the CF response showed that both the reduction in
	
	the [{Ca}$^{2+}$]$_i$ change and the action potential amplitude occurred
	
	in a narrow time window of about 8-10 msec, about the rise time of
	
	the IPSP. Together these results indicate that the CF response activates
	
	a fast dendritic {Ca}$^{2+}$ spike that causes most of the [{Ca}$^{2+}$]$_i$
	
	increase, both of which can be blocked by an inhibitory shunting
	
	conductance. This interaction provides a means whereby {Ca}$^{2+}$-dependent
	
	dendritic mechanisms can be modulated without affecting the immediate
	
	output of the Purkinje cell.},

	equilibrium if players with high degrees of strategic thinking mimic
	or erase the effects of others who do very little strategic thinking.
	Recently developed theories of other-regarding preferences and bounded

	shown to be consistent with the present results if one adjusts the
	time scales in such a way that the center of mass diffuses at the
	same rate in the two models. The relaxation of the stress tensor
	is shown to be quite similar to that of the Rouse model. Finally,
	it is shown that edge effects are much more pronounced in the diffusive
	motion of the individual beads, there being a skin comprising about
	30% of the total polymer, where bead motion is relatively quicker.},

	interneurons (AIB and AIY) that control food- and odour-evoked behaviours.
	Using calcium imaging and mutations that affect specific neuronal
	connections, we show that AWC neurons are activated by odour removal
	and activate the AIB interneurons through AMPA-type glutamate receptors.
	The level of calcium in AIB interneurons is elevated for several
	minutes after odour removal, a neuronal correlate to the prolonged
	behavioural response to odour withdrawal. The AWC neuron inhibits
	AIY interneurons through glutamate-gated chloride channels; odour
	presentation relieves this inhibition and results in activation of
	AIY interneurons. The opposite regulation of AIY and AIB interneurons
	generates a coordinated behavioural response. Information processing
	by this circuit resembles information flow from vertebrate photoreceptors
	to 'OFF' bipolar and 'ON' bipolar neurons, indicating a conserved
	or convergent strategy for sensory information processing.},

  abstract = {Behavioral performance in detection and discrimination tasks is likely
	to be limited by the quality and nature of the signals carried by
	populations of neurons in early sensory cortical areas. Here we used
	voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) to directly measure neural population
	responses in the primary visual cortex (V1) of monkeys performing
	a reaction-time detection task. Focusing on the temporal properties
	of the population responses, we found that V1 responses are consistent
	with a stimulus-evoked response with amplitude and latency that depend
	on target contrast and a stimulus-independent additive noise with
	long-lasting temporal correlations. The noise had much lower amplitude
	than the ongoing activity reported previously in anesthetized animals.
	To understand the implications of these properties for subsequent
	processing stages that mediate behavior, we derived the Bayesian
	ideal observer that specifies how to optimally use neural responses
	in reaction time tasks. Using the ideal observer analysis, we show
	that 1) the observed temporal correlations limit the performance
	benefit that can be attained by accumulating V1 responses over time,
	2) a simple temporal decorrelation operation with time-lagged excitation
	and inhibition minimizes the detrimental effect of these correlations,
	3) the neural information relevant for target detection is concentrated
	in the initial response following stimulus onset, and 4) a decoder
	that optimally uses V1 responses far outperforms the monkey in both
	speed and accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that for our particular
	detection task, temporal decorrelation followed by an appropriate
	running integrator can approach the speed and accuracy of the optimal
	decoder.},

	Results: We pursue the hypothesis that the axon caliber has evolved

	We propose a framework made up of three components, namely (i) a

	method for determining whether the current match is a full-search
	equivalent match, and (iii) an effective technique for improving
	the current match. Our approach is to consider good solutions for

	complexity of the search. We also propose a technique for hierarchical
	ordering and cluster elimination using a minimal cost spanning tree.
	Our experiments on vector quantisation coding of images show that

	the dentate gyrus, most of the collaterals are contained within a
	zone about 400 microns wide. The distribution of the collaterals
	within the hilar region is correlated with the location of the granule
	cell body. Those that arise from cells near the tip of the suprapyramidal
	blade tend to be confined to the region above field CA3; those from
	cells nearer the crest and from the infrapyramidal blade ramify widely
	throughout the hilus. Two types of varicosities are present on the
	collaterals. Numerous small (approximately 2 microns), round varicosities
	are distributed unevenly along the collaterals; in electron micrographs
	these varicosities can be seen to make asymmetric synaptic contacts
	with dendritic shafts. On average, each granule cell collateral plexus
	has about 160 of these varicosities. The second type of varicosity
	is irregular in shape and ranges from 2 to 4 microns in diameter;
	there is usually only one such varicosity per collateral. In all
	respects except size, these varicosities resemble the expansions
	found on the parent mossy fibers. Mossy fiber trajectories in the
	proximal part of field CA3 were studied after extracellular injections
	of HRP into localized regions of the granule cell layer. Granule
	cells at different locations around the blade send their mossy fibers
	to different depths within the pyramidal cell layer in the proximal
	part of field CA3. However, further distally, mossy fibers from all
	parts of the granule cell layer contribute to the suprapyramidal
	bundle that occupies the stratum lucidum.},

  year = {2005},
  abstract = {Network tomography is a process for inferring "internal" link-level
	delay and loss performance information based on end-to-end (edge)
	network measurements. These methods require knowledge of the network
	topology; therefore a first crucial step in the tomography process
	is topology identi- fication. This paper considers the problem of
	discovering network topology solely from host-based, unicast measure-
	ments, without internal network cooperation. First, we in- troduce
	a novel delay-based measurement scheme that does not require clock
	synchronization, making it more practical than other previous proposals.
	Due to the nature of the measurement procedure, our methodology has
	the potential to identify layer two switching elements (provided
	they are logical topology branching points and induce some measur-
	able switching delay). Second, we propose a maximum pe- nalized likelihood
	criterion for topology identification. This is a global optimality
	criterion, in contrast to other recent proposals for topology identification
	that employ subopti- mal, pair-merging strategies. We develop a novel
	Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure for rapid determi- nation
	of the most likely topologies. The performance of our new probing
	scheme and identification algorithm is explored through simulation
	and Internet experiments.},

	With high-speed, precisely-targeted, two-photon point imaging we

	ratio (SVR), we observed that neocortical dendritic spines have a
	
	markedly smaller endogenous buffer capacity with respect to their
	
	parental dendrites. Calcium influx time course and calcium extrusion
	
	rate were both in the same range for spines and dendrites when fitted

	kinetics and diffusion. In a subsequent analysis we used this model

	a higher SVR is not sufficient by itself to explain the faster rise
	
	time kinetics in spines, but only when paired with a lower buffer
	
	capacity in spines. Simulations at zero calcium-dye conditions show
	
	that calmodulin is more efficiently activated in spines, which indicates

	transport in one-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnets with an
	energy gap Delta. For T < Delta, we develop a semiclassical picture
	of thermally excited particles. Multiple inelastic collisions between
	the particles are crucial, and are described by a two-particle S-matrix
	which has a super-universal form at low momenta. This is established
	by computations on the O(3) Ïƒ-model, and strong and weak coupling
	expansions (the latter using a Majorana fermion representation) for
	the two-leg S = 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic ladder. As an aside,
	we note that the strong-coupling calculation reveals a S = 1, two
	particle bound state which leads to the presence of a second peak
	in the T = 0 inelastic neutron scattering (INS) cross-section for
	a range of values of momentum transfer. We obtain exact, or numerically
	exact, universal expressions for the thermal broadening of the quasi-particle
	peak in the INS cross-section, for the magnetization transport, and
	for the field dependence of the NMR relaxation rate 1/T1 of the effective
	semiclassical model: these are expected to be asymptotically exact
	for the quantum antiferromagnets. The results for 1/T1 are compared
	with the experimental findings of Takigawa et.al. and the agreement
	is quite good. In the regime Delta < T < (a typical microscopic exchange)
	we argue that a complementary description in terms of semiclassical
	waves applies, and give some exact results for the thermodynamics
	and dynamics.},

	(CFHT) Adaptive Optics Bonnette (AOB) are used to investigate the

	spiral galaxy M33. AGB stars with near-infrared spectral-energy distributions

	Window are detected over most of the field. Neither the peak brightness
	nor the color of the AGB sequence on the (K, J âˆ’ K) color-magnitude
	diagram changes with distance from the galaxy center. The bolometric
	luminosity function (LF) of these stars has a discontinuity near
	Mbol = âˆ’5.25, and comparisons with evolutionary tracks suggest
	that most of the AGB stars formed in a burst of star formation 1
	âˆ’ 3 Gyr in the past, indicating that the star formation rate near
	the center of M33 has varied significantly during the past few Gyr.
	The images are also used to investigate the integrated near-infrared
	photometric properties of the nucleus and the central light concentration.
	The nucleus is bluer than the central light concentration, in agreement
	with previous studies at visible wavelengths. The near-infrared photometric
	properties of the nucleus are reminiscent of relatively young clusters

	The CO index of the central light concentration 0.5 arcsec from the

	necessary to complement the electrical patch pipette measurements
	with technologies that permit a massive parallel recording from many
	sites on neuronal processes. This can be achieved by using voltage
	imaging with intracellular dyes. With this approach, we investigated
	the functional structure of a mitral cell, the principal output neuron
	in the rat olfactory bulb. The most significant finding concerns
	the characteristics of EPSPs at the synaptic sites and surprisingly
	small attenuation along the trunk of the primary dendrite. Also,
	the experiments were performed to determine the number, location,
	and stability of spike trigger zones, the excitability of terminal
	dendritic branches, and the pattern and nature of spike initiation
	and propagation in the primary and secondary dendrites. The results
	show that optical data can be used to deduce the amplitude and shape
	of the EPSPs evoked by olfactory nerve stimulation at the site of
	origin (glomerular tuft) and to determine its attenuation along the
	entire length of the primary dendrite. This attenuation corresponds
	to an unusually large mean apparent "length constant" of the primary
	dendrite. Furthermore, the images of spike trigger zones showed that
	an action potential can be initiated in three different compartments
	of the mitral cell: the soma-axon region, the primary dendrite trunk,
	and the terminal dendritic tuft, which appears to be fully excitable.
	Finally, secondary dendrites clearly support the active propagation
	of action potentials.},

  abstract = {The inputoutput transform performed by mitral cells, the principal
	projection neurons of the olfactory bulb, is one of the key factors
	in understanding olfaction. We used combined calcium and voltage
	imaging from the same neuron and computer modeling to investigate
	signal processing in the mitral cells, focusing on the glomerular
	dendritic tuft. The main finding was that the dendritic tuft functions
	as a single electrical compartment for subthreshold signals within
	the range of amplitudes detectable by voltage-sensitive dye recording.
	These evoked EPSPs had uniform characteristics throughout the glomerular
	tuft. The Ca2+ transients associated with spatially uniform subthreshold
	synaptic potentials were comparable but not equal in amplitude in
	all regions. The average range of normalized amplitudes of the EPSP-driven
	Ca2+ signals from different locations on dendritic branches in the
	glomerular tuft was relatively narrow and appeared to be independent
	of the dendritic surface-to-volume ratio. The computer simulations
	constrained by the imaging data indicated that a synchronized activation

  abstract = {We report a technique for two-photon fluorescence imaging with cellular
	resolution in awake, behaving mice with minimal motion artifact.
	The apparatus combines an upright, table-mounted two-photon microscope
	with a spherical treadmill consisting of a large, air-supported Styrofoam
	ball. Mice, with implanted cranial windows, are head restrained under
	the objective while their limbs rest on the ball's upper surface.
	Following adaptation to head restraint, mice maneuver on the spherical
	treadmill as their heads remain motionless. Image sequences demonstrate
	that running-associated brain motion is limited to approximately
	2-5 microm. In addition, motion is predominantly in the focal plane,
	with little out-of-plane motion, making the application of a custom-designed
	Hidden-Markov-Model-based motion correction algorithm useful for
	postprocessing. Behaviorally correlated calcium transients from large
	neuronal and astrocytic populations were routinely measured, with
	an estimated motion-induced false positive error rate of <5\%.},

	stage (6-7 hpf) of development, and less effective at earlier stages
	(e.g., 3 hpf) or later stages (e.g., 12 hpf). Embryos at the cleavage
	stage of development were found to be tolerant to extreme levels

	appearance could exhibit a disrupted vascular patterning, suggesting
	that this endpoint could provide a sensitive tool for detection of

  abstract = {Multipolar cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) are a structurally
	
	and functionally diverse group of projection neurons. Understanding
	
	their role in the ascending pathway involves partitioning multipolar
	
	cells into distinct populations and determining where in the brain
	
	each sends its coded messages. In this study, we used retrograde
	
	labeling techniques in rats to identify multipolar neurons that project
	
	their axons to the ipsilateral dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), the
	
	contralateral CN, or both structures. Three rats received injections
	
	of biotinylated dextran amine in the ipsilateral DCN and diamidino
	
	yellow in the contralateral CN. Several radiate multipolar neurons
	
	(defined by their axonal projections to the ipsilateral DCN and their
	
	dendrites that traverse VCN isofrequency sheets) were double-labeled
	
	but over 70\% were not. This result suggests two distinct populations:
	
	(1) radiate-commissural (RC) multipolar cells that project to the
	
	ipsilateral DCN and the contralateral CN, and (2) radiate multipolar
	
	cells that project exclusively (in this context) to the ipsilateral
	
	DCN. In a different group of animals, we retrogradely labeled multipolar
	
	neurons that project their axons to the contralateral CN and measured
	
	the size of their cell bodies. The mean size of this population (266
	
	+/- 156 microm2) was significantly smaller than those of RC-multipolar
	
	cells (418 +/- 140 microm2). We conclude that the CN commissural
	
	pathway is composed of at least two components: (1) RC multipolar
	
	cells and (2) commissural multipolar cells that are small- and medium-sized
	
	neurons that project exclusively (in this context) to the contralateral
	
	CN. These results identify separate structural groups of multipolar
	
	cells that may correspond to physiological unit types described in
	
	the literature. They also provide protocols for isolating and studying
	
	different populations of multipolar cells to determine the neural
	
	mechanisms that govern their responses to sound.},

	At longer times of agonist exposure (>2 hours), a marked increase

	Solubilization of this class of Galpha proteins was thus observed

	static (point, line, ring, and plane) attractors; cyclic attractors;
	and chaotic attractors. I discuss these attractors in the context
	of the neural systems that they have been posited to help explain:
	eye control, working memory, and head direction; locomotion (specifically
	swimming); and olfaction, respectively. I then demonstrate how to
	introduce control into these models. The addition of control shows
	how attractor networks can be used as subsystems in larger neural
	systems, demonstrates how a much larger class of networks can be
	related to attractor networks, and makes it clear how attractor networks
	can be exploited for various information processing tasks in neurobiological
	systems.},

  abstract = {1. We characterized the kinetics of presynaptic Ca2+ ion concentration
	
	in optic nerve fibers and terminals of the optic tectum in Rana pipiens
	
	with the use of microfluorimetry. Isolated frog brains were incubated
	
	with the membrane-permeant tetraacetoxymethyl ester (AM) of the Ca2+
	
	indicator fura-2. An optic nerve shock caused a transient decrease
	
	in the 380-nm excited fluorescence in the optic tectum with a rise
	
	time of <15 ms and a recovery to prestimulus levels on a time scale
	
	of seconds. 2. In normal saline, the amplitude of the fluorescence
	
	transients was dependent on stimulus intensity and at all levels
	
	it was directly correlated with the amplitude of postsynaptic field
	
	potentials produced by activation of unmyelinated optic nerve fibers.
	
	In the presence of the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor
	
	antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, the amplitude and
	
	time course of fluorescence transients remained essentially unchanged
	
	while postsynaptic field potential amplitude was greatly reduced.
	
	Replacing extracellular Ca2+ with Ba2+ blocked unfacilitated postsynaptic
	
	field potentials while fluorescence transients remained significant.
	
	In reduced-Ca2+ salines (<1 mM), the amplitude of fluorescence transients
	
	increased approximately linearly with extracellular [Ca2+], whereas
	
	the amplitude the corresponding field potential was nonlinearly related
	
	to the fluorescent transient amplitude (approximately 2.5 power).
	
	In thin sections of labeled tecta, fluorescence labeling was localized
	
	to 1-micron puncta in the termination zone of optic nerve fibers
	
	in the superficial layers. Taken together, these results provide
	
	strong evidence that the fluorescence transients correspond to an
	
	increase in Ca2+ in presynaptic terminals of unmyelinated optic nerve
	
	fibers. 3. During trains of optic nerve stimulation, the amplitude
	
	of fluorescence transients to succeeding action potentials became
	
	smaller. The decrement of the amplitudes was not observed in mag-fura-5-labeled
	
	tecta, when the intracellular Ca2+ buffering capacity of fura-2-labeled
	
	terminals was increased by incubation with bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic
	
	acid (BAPTA)-AM or ethylene glycol-bis (beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic
	
	acid (EGTA)-AM, or in low-Ca2+ saline. We conclude that the Ca2+
	
	influx per action potential is constant during the train and that
	
	the reduced response was produced by saturation of the fura-2. We
	
	provide a mathematical analysis of this saturation effect and use
	
	it to estimate the Ca2+ change per action potential. 4. Both BAPTA-AM
	
	and EGTA-AM reduced the overall amplitude of fura-2-measured Ca2+
	
	transients and reduced the saturation effect in action potential
	
	trains. However, there was a qualitative difference in their effects
	
	on the shape of the transient. Incubation with the fast buffer BAPTA
	
	prolonged the decay to baseline. In contrast, the slow buffer EGTA
	
	(or EDTA) produced an initial decay faster than the control condition
	
	while also producing the slower subsequent phase observed with BAPTA.
	
	We demonstrate that these results are consistent with numerical simulations
	
	of Ca2+ dynamics in a single-compartment model where the fast initial
	
	decay is produced by the forward rate of Ca2+ binding to EGTA. 5.
	
	Ca2+ influx into tectal presynaptic structures, and also into unmyelinated
	
	axons in the isolated optic nerve, was diminished (60-70\%) in the
	
	presence of the voltage-activated Ca2+ channel blocker omega-conotoxin
	
	GVIA, but was only weakly affected (approximately 10\%) by omega-agatoxin
	
	IVA. 6. After 10- to 50-Hz stimulus trains, synaptic enhancement
	
	of unmyelinated fibers decayed with a characteristic time similar
	
	to fura-2 fluorescence decays. Incubation with EDTA-AM or EGTA-AM
	
	produced little effect on evoked release but reduced both the amplitude
	
	of the fura-2-measured Ca2+ transient and the amplitude of short-term
	
	synaptic enhancement.},

	in circuits involving granule cells in the cochlear nuclei. To understand
	
	their physiological role, intracellular recordings were made from
	
	anatomically identified Golgi cells in slices of the cochlear nuclei
	
	from mice. Cell bodies, dendrites, and terminals for all seven labeled
	
	cells were restricted to the narrow plane of the superficial granule
	
	cell domain over the ventral cochlear nucleus. The axonal arborization
	
	was the most striking feature of all Golgi cells; a dense plexus
	
	of terminals covered an area 200-400 microm in diameter in the vicinity
	
	of the cell body and dendrites. Axonal beads often surrounded granule
	
	cell bodies, indicating that granule cells are probable targets.
	
	Cells had input resistances up to 130 M omega and fired regular,
	
	overshooting action potentials. Golgi cells probably receive auditory
	
	nerve input, because shocks to the cut end of the auditory nerve
	
	excited Golgi cells with excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs).
	
	The latency of EPSPs shortened to a minimum and the amplitude of
	
	EPSPs grew in several steps as the strength of shocks was increased.
	
	The minimum latency of EPSPs in Golgi cells was on average 1.3 milliseconds,
	
	0.6 milliseconds longer than the minimum latencies of EPSPs in nearby
	
	octopus and T stellate cells. The long latency raises the possibility
	
	that Golgi cells receive input from slowly conducting, unmyelinated
	
	auditory nerve fibers. Golgi cells are also excited by interneurons

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Analysis of brain ultrastructure is needed to reveal how
	neurons communicate with one another via synapses and how disease
	processes alter this communication. In the past, such analyses have
	usually been based on single or paired sections obtained by electron
	microscopy. Reconstruction from multiple serial sections provides
	a much needed, richer representation of the three-dimensional organization
	of the brain. This paper introduces a new reconstruction system and
	new methods for analyzing in three dimensions the location and ultrastructure
	of neuronal components, such as synapses, which are distributed non-randomly
	throughout the brain. DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: Volumes are reconstructed
	by defining transformations that align the entire area of adjacent
	sections. Whole-field alignment requires rotation, translation, skew,
	scaling, and second-order nonlinear deformations. Such transformations
	are implemented by a linear combination of bivariate polynomials.
	Computer software for generating transformations based on user input
	is described. Stereological techniques for assessing structural distributions
	in reconstructed volumes are the unbiased bricking, disector, unbiased
	ratio, and per-length counting techniques. A new general method,
	the fractional counter, is also described. This unbiased technique
	relies on the counting of fractions of objects contained in a test
	volume. A volume of brain tissue from stratum radiatum of hippocampal
	area CA1 is reconstructed and analyzed for synaptic density to demonstrate
	and compare the techniques. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Reconstruction
	makes practicable volume-oriented analysis of ultrastructure using
	such techniques as the unbiased bricking and fractional counter methods.
	These analysis methods are less sensitive to the section-to-section
	variations in counts and section thickness, factors that contribute
	to the inaccuracy of other stereological methods. In addition, volume
	reconstruction facilitates visualization and modeling of structures
	and analysis of three-dimensional relationships such as synaptic
	connectivity.},

	a selection mechanism to achieve slow learning, which is shown to

	pretherapeutically. METHODS AND RESULTS: 17 patients with LARA, clinical
	stage II, III according to IUCC were enrolled into our pilot study.
	Response to therapy was determined clinically by transrectal ultrasonography
	and CT/MRI before and after therapy and histopathologically by TRG
	(tumor regression grade) according to Mandard. Patients with TRG
	1-2 were included to responders group (R) and patients with TRG 4-5

	by low-density oligonucleotide microarrays. Gene expression data
	analysis based on SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) and
	t-test methods identified 8 genes (RB1, RBBP4, HYOUI, JUNB, MDM4,
	CANX, MMP2, TCF7L2) significantly upregulated in NR. CONCLUSIONS:
	Validation of identified changes on the mRNA level (Real-Time PCR)
	and on protein level (immunohistochemistry) is ongoing. We suggest
	that low-density oligonucleotide microarray technology could contribute

  abstract = {BACKGROUDS: Neoadjuvant concomitant chemoradiotherapy has become a
	standard treatment of locally advanced rectal adenocarcinomas (LARA).
	It leads to shrinkage of the tumor mass and subsequently to an increase
	in complete resections (R0 resections), increasing a feasibility
	of sphincter-sparing intervention avoiding colostomy. It is based
	on concurrent application of fluoropyrimidines (5-fluorouracil, capecitabine)
	and radiotherapy (45 - 50,4 Gy). It shows less acute toxicity and
	improves local control rate in comparison to adjuvant treatment.
	Unfortunately, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is not beneficial for
	all patients. The treatment response ranges from a complete pathological
	remission (pCR, ypT0ypN0) to a resistance. It is reported that cca
	15 percent of patients with advanced rectal cancer show pCR which
	is indicative of improved long-term prognosis. DESIGN: The following
	is a review of the significance of neoadjuvant concomitant chemoradiotherapy
	in the treatment algorithm of patients with LARA and summary of potentional
	clinical-pathological and molecular markers of response prediction
	to neoadjuvant therapy. The most important clinical studies concern
	serum tumor markers levels, clinical lymph node classification. The
	components of the carcinogenic pathways are explored, including oncogenes,
	tumor supressor genes, microsatellite instability (MSI) and potentional
	markers involved in apoptosis, angiogionesis, proliferation as well
	as metastasis and invasion, are reviewed. Finally, the role of specific
	enzymes associated with the metabolism of fluoropyrimidines are examined.
	CONCLUSIONS: No one marker has been consistently identified as clinically
	applicable. Studies designed to determine the potentional markers
	are hampered by various techniques as well as tumor heterogenity
	and recent scientific approach--studying individual molecular markers.
	Gene expression profiling analysis of multiple genes from the same
	tumor is becoming reality. We suppose that this assessment will lead
	in future in finding combination of markers for predicting prognosis
	and response to therapy in rectal cancer.},

  abstract = {A path-integral formulation of quantum mechanics is ivestigated which
	is closely related to that of Feynman. It differs from Feynman's
	formulation in that it involves the Hamiltnoian function of the canonically
	conjugate coordinates and momenta. The classical limit yields the
	variational principle: delta f(p-N)dt=0. A path integral formula
	is also obtained for the energy eigenstate projection operator associated
	with the time-independent Schrodinger equation. The classical limit
	of the projection operator formula yields a modified form of the
	well-known variational principle for the phase-space orbit of given
	energy. Relativistically covariant Hamiltonian variational principles
	are analyzed and lead naturally to a relativistic scalar wave equation
	which involves a proper time variable which is canonically conjugate
	to the mass in the same manner as the ordinary time variable is conjugate
	to the energy in nonrelativistic quantum theory.},

  abstract = {Polygon/spline approximation of arbitrary image region shapes is submitted
	for tool evaluation. First, polygon approximation is performed. Starting
	with an initial 4Â–vertices polygon which represents the farest elongations
	into different directions, the polygon approximation is iteratively
	refined taking into account the local requirements until a given
	tolerance criterion is satisfied everywhere. Then, spline approximation
	is calculated using the polygon vertices. Whenever spline approximation
	also satisfies the tolerance criterion for a certain part of the
	shape, spline approximation substitutes polygon approximation for
	that part thus giving the approximated shape a more natural look.
	By this combined approach, the advantages of both techniques are
	utilized and their disadvantages avoided. Thus, the combined approach
	is efficient in terms of reduction of the number of shape points
	for which coordinates must be transmitted and with this also in terms
	of bit rate reduction. It has no interdependency during the iterative
	refinement of the approximation in different parts of the shape,
	and it has a natural look. Predictive coding is proposed for further

  abstract = {The integrative contribution of cartwheel cells of the dorsal cochlear
	nucleus (DCN) was assessed with intracellular recordings from anatomically
	identified cells. Recordings were made, in slices of the cochlear
	nuclei of mice, from 58 cartwheel cells, 22 fusiform cells, 3 giant
	cells, 5 tuberculoventral cells, and 1 cell that is either a superficial
	stellate or Golgi cell. Cartwheel cells can be distinguished electrophysiologically
	from other cells of the cochlear nuclei by their complex spikes,
	which comprised two to four rapid action potentials superimposed
	on a slower depolarization. The rapid action potentials were blocked
	by tetrodotoxin (n = 17) and were therefore mediated by voltage-sensitive
	sodium currents. The slow spikes were eliminated by the removal of
	calcium from the extracellular saline (n = 3) and thus were mediated
	by voltage-sensitive calcium currents. The spontaneous and evoked
	firing patterns of cartwheel cells were distinctive. Cartwheel cells
	usually fired single and complex spikes spontaneously at irregular
	intervals of between 100 ms and several seconds. Shocks to the DCN
	elicited firing that lasted tens to hundreds of milliseconds. With
	the use of these distinctive firing patterns, together with a pharmacological
	dissection of postsynaptic potentials (PSPs), possible targets of
	cartwheel cells were identified and the function of the connections
	was examined. Not only cartwheel and fusiform cells, but also giant
	cells, received patterns of synaptic input consistent with their
	having originated from cartwheel cells. These cell types responded
	to shocks of the DCN with variable trains of PSPs that lasted hundreds
	of milliseconds. PSPs within these trains appeared both singly and
	in bursts of two to four, and were blocked by 0.5 or 1 microM strychnine
	(n = 4 cartwheel, 4 fusiform, and 2 giant cells), indicating that
	cartwheel cells are likely to be glycinergic. In contrast with cartwheel
	cells, which are weakly excited by glycinergic input, glycinergic
	PSPs consistently inhibited fusiform and giant cells. Tuberculoventral
	cells and the putative superficial stellate cell received little
	or no spontaneous synaptic activity. Shocks to the DCN evoked synaptic
	activity that lasted approximately 5 ms. These cells therefore probably
	do not receive input from cartwheel cells. In addition, the brief
	firing of tuberculoventral cells and of the putative superficial
	stellate cell in response to shocks indicates that these cells are
	unlikely to contribute to the late, glycinergic synaptic potentials
	observed in cartwheel, fusiform, and giant cells.},

	cells. They contact other cartwheel cells as well as fusiform cells,
	the principal cells of the DCN. In fusiform cells, the inhibition
	from cartwheel cells interacts with excitation mediated by granule
	cells and auditory nerve fibers, and shapes the output of the DCN
	in its ascent to the inferior colliculi. With intracellular recordings
	from anatomically identified cells in slices, synaptic inputs to
	fusiform and cartwheel cells were analyzed pharmacologically. Shocks
	to the auditory nerve and granule cell domains evoked glutamatergic,
	glycinergic, and GABA(A)ergic postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) in both
	cartwheel and fusiform cells. The temporal patterns of spontaneous
	and evoked glycinergic PSPs in fusiform and cartwheel cells were
	similar and mirrored the pattern of firing of cartwheel cells, probably
	reflecting the anatomical connections between these cell types and
	supporting the conclusion that cartwheel cells are glycinergic. In
	fusiform cells, glycinergic and GABA(A)ergic IPSPs evoked with shocks
	reversed at -68 mV on average. In marked contrast, glycinergic and
	GABA(A)ergic PSPs in cartwheel cells, as well as responses to exogenous
	application of 50-100 mM glycine or 100 microns muscimol, were depolarizing.
	Reversal potentials of PSPs and responses to glycine and muscimol
	were similar and averaged -52 mV. Glycinergic and GABA(A)ergic PSPs
	could elicit firing from cartwheel cells at their resting potentials,

  abstract = {Two-photon imaging of bulk-loaded calcium dyes can record action potentials
	(APs) simultaneously from dozens of spatially resolved neurons in
	vivo. Extending this technique to awake animals, however, has remained
	technically challenging due to artifacts caused by brain motion.
	Since in two-photon excitation microscopes image pixels are captured
	sequentially by scanning a focused pulsed laser across small areas
	of interest within the brain, fast displacements of the imaged area
	can distort the image nonuniformly. If left uncorrected, brain motion
	in awake animals will cause artifactual fluorescence changes, masking
	the small functional fluorescence increases associated with AP discharge.
	We therefore present a procedure for detection and correction of
	both fast and slow displacements in two-photon imaging of awake animals.
	Our algorithm, based on the Lucas–Kanade framework, operates directly
	on the motion-distorted imaging data, requiring neither external
	signals such as heartbeat nor a distortion-free template image. Motion
	correction accuracy was tested in silico over a wide range of simplified
	and realistic displacement trajectories and for multiple levels of
	fluorescence noise. Accuracy was confirmed in vivo by comparing solutions
	obtained from red and green fluorophores imaged simultaneously. Finally,
	the accuracy of AP detection from motion-displaced bulk-loaded calcium
	imaging is evaluated with and without motion correction, and we conclude
	that accurate motion correction as achieved by this procedure is
	both necessary and sufficient for single AP detection in awake animals.},

	we include higher Fock states up to six particles. Our results are

	light-front renormalization, Quantum Electrodynamics in one space
	- one time dimensions is discussed along with the consideration of

	One of the consequences of light-front power counting in the simple
	setting of one space - one time dimensions is illustrated using massive

	on four main physical principles: heat is a local form of energy,
	therefore described by a thermal energy tensor; conservation of mass,
	equivalent to conservation of heat, or the local rst law; entropy
	is a local current; and non-destruction of entropy, or the local
	second law. A uid is defined by the thermostatic energy tensor being
	isotropic. The entropy current is related to the other yields by
	certain equations, including a generalised Gibbs equation for the
	thermostatic entropy, followed by linear and quadratic terms in the
	dissipative (thermal minus thermostatic) energy tensor. Then the
	second law suggests certain equations for the dissipative energy
	tensor, generalising the Israel-Stewart dissipative relations, which
	describe heat conduction and viscosity including relativistic effects
	and relaxation effects. In the thermostatic case, the perfect-liquid
	model is recovered. In the linear approximation for entropy, the
	Eckart theory is recovered. In the quadratic approximation for entropy,
	the theory is similar to that of Israel & Stewart, but involving
	neither state-space differentials, nor a non-equilibrium Gibbs equation,
	nor non-material frames. Also, unlike conventional thermodynamics,
	the thermal energy density is not assumed to be purely thermostatic,
	though this is derived in the linear approximation. Otherwise, the
	theory reduces in the non-relativistic limit to the extended thermodynamics
	of irreversible processes due to Muller. The dissipative energy density

  abstract = {The path integral formulation of quantum mechanics constructs the
	propagator by evaluating the action, S, for all classical paths in
	coordinate space. A corresponding momentum path integral may also
	be defined through Fourier transforms in the endpoints. These momentum
	path integrals are especially simple for several special cases, yet
	no one has, to my knowledge, ever formally constructed them from
	first principles, i.e., by considering all classical paths in momentum
	space. I show that this is possible because there exists another
	classical mechanics based on an alternate classical action, R. Hamiltonï¾’s
	Canonical equations result from a variational principle in both S
	and R. S uses fixed beginning and ending spatial points while R uses
	fixed beginning and ending momentum points. This alternative actionï¾’s
	classical mechanics also includes a Hamilton- Jacobi equation. I
	also present some important subtle points concerning the beginning
	and ending conditions on the action necessary to apply a Canonical
	transformation. These properties explain the failure of the Canonical
	transformation in the phase space path integral. It follows that
	a path integral may be formulated from first principles using S in
	the coordinate representation, or R, in the momentum representation.
	Several example calculations are presented that illustrate this broader
	view of the path integral. In particular, the normalized amplitude
	for a free particle is found without using the SchrÃ¶dinger equation,
	the internal spin degree of freedom is simply and naturally derived,
	and the simple harmonic oscillator is calculated.},

  note = {This paper provides an overview to black hole Hocking's radiation

  abstract = {The prediction that black holes radiate due to quantum effects is
	often considered one of the most secure in quantum field theory in
	curved spaceÂ–time. Yet this prediction rests on two dubious assumptions:
	that ordinary physics may be applied to vacuum fluctuations at energy
	scales increasing exponentially without bound; and that quantumÂ–gravitational
	effects may be neglected. Various suggestions have been put forward
	to address these issues: that they might be explained away by lessons
	from sonic black hole models; that the prediction is indeed successfully
	reproduced by quantum gravity; that the success of the link provided
	by the prediction between black holes and thermodynamics justifies
	the prediction. This paper explains the nature of the difficulties,
	and reviews the proposals that have been put forward to deal with
	them. None of the proposals put forward can so far be considered
	to be really successful, and simple dimensional arguments show that
	quantumÂ–gravitational effects might well alter the evaporation process
	outlined by Hawking. Thus a definitive theoretical treatment will
	require an understanding of quantum gravity in at least some regimes.
	Until then, no compelling theoretical case for or against radiation
	by black holes is likely to be made. The possibility that nonÂ–radiating
	ï¾“miniï¾” black holes exist should be taken seriously; such holes
	could be part of the dark matter in the Universe. Attempts to place
	observational limits on the number of ï¾“miniï¾” black holes (independent
	of the assumption that they radiate) would be most welcome.},

	hypothesis that iron accumulation might cause fibrosis of the palmar
	aponeurosis leading to DD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined iron
	metabolism, mutations of the HFE gene, serum cholesterol, alcohol
	consumption, presence of chronic liver disease, diabetes and history
	of severe manual work in a group of 90 patients who had undergone
	surgery for a severe form of DD. The tissue removed during surgery
	was histologically examined to confirm the diagnosis of DD. For a
	control group, we used 33 healthy subjects with similar profiles.
	RESULTS: The DD group consisted of 82 men and 8 women. Chronic liver
	disease was found in 27\% of DD patients, compared with 6.1\% of
	control subjects (P = 0.013). A history of hand traumatization was
	present in 33\% of DD patients vs. 15\% of control subjects (P =
	0.048). Excessive alcohol consumption was present in 35.5\% of DD
	patients compared with 15.1\% of controls (P = 0.029). None of the
	other tested parameters, including the prevalence of HFE gene mutations,
	showed a significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS:
	Iron accumulation does not play a major role in the pathogenesis
	of DD. However, sex, age, manual labour and alcohol consumption are
	risk factors for progression of DD. We observed a high incidence
	of chronic liver disease in patients with DD.},

	at different portions of the boundary; and it is frequently a challenge

	segmentation, a multiscale extension of image profile models akin
	to those in Active Shape Models. A spherical-harmonic based 3D shape
	representation provides a mapping of the object boundary to the sphere
	S2, and a scale-space for profiles on the sphere defines a scalespace
	on the object. A key feature is that profiles are not blurred across
	the object boundary, but only along the boundary. This profile scalespace
	is sampled in a coarse-to-fine fashion to produce features for the
	statistical image-match model. A framework for model-building and
	segmentation has been built, and testing and validation are in progress
	with a dataset of 70 segmented images of the caudate nucleus.},

  pages = {337},
  number = {1},
  note = {The paper deals with the question how a network subjected to plasticity
	may maintain stability in performing its task [here odor recognition
	in olfaction] in the presence of changes noise due to plasticity.
	The question is addressed on the example of artificial neural network
	for olfaction odor recognition. The plasticity rule is as follows:
	a value function is assigned for each presynaptic neuron depending
	on the time difference between pre \& postsynaptic cells firings.
	This is a bell shaped function promoting value of neurons firing
	in synchrony with two negative wings suppressing neurons that also
	fire out of synchrony [all the time]. After each postsynaptic cell
	firing, all presynaptic connections are removed and a fixed number
	[200] of new connections with the highest values are made. System
	shows stability of recognition despite drastic update rule and ability
	to learn by initially broadly tuned cell the odor at which original
	synaptic update was initiated. Conjecture is made that general learning
	rule which favor better synchrony will result in rearrangement of
	connections toward "sooner" spiking. This is said to be related to
	the "center of mass" of the "value" curve associated with learning.
	Small tail of positive values for "negative" relative timings is
	needed to prevent such drift due to zeroing the center of mass. This
	is said to reflect the fact that due to jitter in timing relevant
	cells some times may fire before postsynaptic cell and by this should
	be given credit in learning rule. General bottomline is as follows:
	"conservatism" allows system to maintain its function even in the
	presence of substantial plasticity: as long as majority follows the
	same route, changes in the system will not disrupt its function;
	conservatism here is implemented via synchrony criteria - when many
	cells spike together, noise in their spiking may be overwhelmed by
	presence of the cells number. I don't really buy right away the arguments
	about drift and center of mass of learning curve.},
  abstract = {Plasticity in connections between neurons allows learning and adaptation,
	but it also allows noise to degrade the function of a network. Ongoing
	network self-repair is thus necessary. We describe a method to derive
	spike-timing-dependent plasticity rules for self-repair, based on
	the firing patterns of a functioning network. These plasticity rules
	for self-repair also provide the basis for unsupervised learning
	of new tasks. The particular plasticity rule derived for a network
	depends on the network and task. Here, self-repair is illustrated
	for a model of the mammalian olfactory system in which the computational
	task is that of odor recognition. In this olfactory example, the
	derived rule has qualitative similarity with experimental results
	seen in spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Unsupervised learning
	of new tasks by using the derived self-repair rule is demonstrated
	by learning to recognize new odors.},

  journal = {Philosophical transactions of the royal society B},
  year = {2005},
  pages = {1},
  abstract = {This year, the field of neuroscience celebrates the 50th anniversary
	of Mountcastleï¾’s discovery of the cortical column. In this review,we
	summarize half a century of research and come to the disappointing
	realization that the column may have no function. Originally, it
	was described as a discrete structure, spanning the layers of the
	somatosensory cortex, which contains cells responsive to only a single
	modality, such as deep joint receptors or cutaneous receptors. Subsequently,
	examples of columns have been uncovered in numerous cortical areas,
	expanding the original concept to embrace a variety of different
	structures and principles. A ï¾‘columnï¾’ now refers to cells in
	any vertical cluster that share the same tuning for any given receptive
	field attribute. In striate cortex, for example, cells with the same
	eye preference are grouped into ocular dominance columns. Unaccountably,
	ocular dominance columns are present in some species, but not others.
	In principle, it should be possible to determine their function by
	searching for species differences in visual performance that correlate
	with their presence or absence. Unfortunately, this approach has
	been to no avail; no visual faculty has emerged that appears to require
	ocular dominance columns. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that
	the expression of ocular dominance columns can be highly variable
	among members of the same species, or even in different portions
	of the visual cortex in the same individual. These observations deal
	a fatal blow to the idea that ocular dominance columns serve a purpose.
	More broadly, the term ï¾‘columnï¾’ also denotes the periodic termination
	of anatomical projections within or between cortical areas. In many
	instances, periodic projections have a consistent relationship with
	some architectural feature, such as the cytochrome oxidase patches
	in V1 or the stripes in V2. These tissue compartments appear to divide
	cells with different receptive field properties into distinct processing
	streams. However, it is unclear what advantage, if any, is conveyed
	by this form of columnar segregation. Although the column is an attractive
	concept, it has failed as a unifying principle for understanding
	cortical function. Unravelling the organization of the cerebral cortex
	will require a painstaking description of the circuits, projections
	and response properties peculiar to cells in each of its various
	areas.},

	O3. The overall reaction scheme, O3 + hn + 3O2 Â® 3O3, produces more

  abstract = {Biophysically accurate multicompartmental models of individual neurons
	
	have significantly advanced our understanding of the input-output
	
	function of single cells. These models depend on a large number of
	
	parameters that are difficult to estimate. In practice, they are
	
	often hand-tuned to match measured physiological behaviors, thus
	
	raising questions of identifiability and interpretability. We propose
	
	a statistical approach to the automatic estimation of various biologically
	
	relevant parameters, including 1) the distribution of channel densities,
	
	2) the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic input, and 3) axial resistances
	
	across extended dendrites. Recent experimental advances, notably
	
	in voltage-sensitive imaging, motivate us to assume access to: i)
	
	the spatiotemporal voltage signal in the dendrite and ii) an approximate
	
	description of the channel kinetics of interest. We show here that,
	
	given i and ii, parameters 1-3 can be inferred simultaneously by
	
	nonnegative linear regression; that this optimization problem possesses
	
	a unique solution and is guaranteed to converge despite the large
	
	number of parameters and their complex nonlinear interaction; and
	
	that standard optimization algorithms efficiently reach this optimum
	
	with modest computational and data requirements. We demonstrate that
	
	the method leads to accurate estimations on a wide variety of challenging
	
	model data sets that include up to about 10(4) parameters (roughly
	
	two orders of magnitude more than previously feasible) and describe
	
	how the method gives insights into the functional interaction of
	
	groups of channels.},

	length of CA3 pyramidal cells varied in a consistent fashion depending
	on their position within the field. Cells located close to the dentate

	in total length. Cells in the distal part of CA3 (near CA2) had the
	largest dendritic trees, averaging 15,800 microns. The CA2 field
	contained cells which resembled CA3 pyramidal cells in most respects
	except for the absence of thorny excrescences on their proximal dendrites.
	There were also smaller pyramidal cells that resembled CA1 neurons.
	CA1 pyramidal cells tended to be more homogeneous. Pyramidal neurons
	throughout the transverse extent of CA1 had a total dendritic length
	on the order of 13,500 microns. The quantitative analysis of the
	laminar distribution of dendrites demonstrated that the stratum oriens

	cell dendritic trees. In Ca3, for example, 42-51% of the total dendritic
	length was located in stratum oriens; about 34% of the dendritic

  abstract = {Many real-world networks describe systems in which interactions decay
	with the distance between nodes. Examples include systems constrained
	in real space such as transportation and communication networks,
	as well as systems constrained in abstract spaces such as multivariate
	biological or economic datasets and models of social networks. These
	networks often display network motifs: subgraphs that recur in the
	network much more often than in randomized networks. To understand
	the origin of the network motifs in these networks, it is important
	to study the subgraphs and network motifs that arise solely from
	geometric constraints. To address this, we analyze geometric network
	models, in which nodes are arranged on a lattice and edges are formed
	with a probability that decays with the distance between nodes. We
	present analytical solutions for the numbers of all 3 and 4-node
	subgraphs, in both directed and non-directed geometric networks.
	We also analyze geometric networks with arbitrary degree sequences,
	and models with a field that biases for directed edges in one direction.
	Scaling rules for scaling of subgraph numbers with system size, lattice
	dimension and interaction range are given. Several invariant measures
	are found, such as the ratio of feedback and feed-forward loops,
	which do not depend on system size, dimension or connectivity function.
	We find that network motifs in many real-world networks, including
	social networks and neuronal networks, are not captured solely by
	these geometric models. This is in line with recent evidence that
	biological network motifs were selected as basic circuit elements
	with defined information-processing functions.},

	a novel approach to functional imaging, termed random-access multiphoton
	(RAMP) microscopy, which combines multiphoton excitation with an
	inertia-free scanning mechanism. RAMP microscopy employs two-dimensional
	acousto-optic deflection to rapidly position a focused near-infrared
	ultrafast laser beam between dwell periods at multiple user-selected
	sites. Because neuronal structures are generally sparse, activity
	located throughout various compartments, including thin dendritic
	branches and spines, can be mapped at high frame rates while maintaining
	the signal-to-noise ratio of conventional scanning microscopy. Moreover,
	RAMP microscopy maintains the excellent structural imaging capability
	of multiphoton excitation, i.e., intrinsic optical sectioning and
	high lateral resolution from within highly light-scattering brain
	tissue. RAMP microscopy thus comprises a versatile tool for investigating
	correlations of dendritic structure and function with significantly

	by the vacuum energy density that gets lowered when the quasiparticles
	are formed. In the (phi^6)1+1 theory, we found two physically meaningful
	duality-related quasiparticle solutions which have different symmetry

	of a diatomic anion has been proposed. The main purpose of the study
	is to provide a simple model to better understand the effect of strong
	coupling between the solvent polarization and the extra charge in
	a system like I2 2. The model diatomic anion consists of two identical
	nuclei and an extra electron whose dynamics are treated explicitly.
	The effect of solvent polarization is modeled by introducing an effective
	solvent field representing a nonequilibrium solvent configuration.
	Nonadiabatic theoretical calculations, in which the electronic and
	the nuclear dynamics are treated simultaneously, can reveal the importance
	of nonadiabatic effects by including intrinsically all the electronic
	states involved. It is found that a purely dissociative excited state
	can support recombination due to coupling of the anomalous charge
	distribution with the solvent polarization. The charge switching
	and the subsequent charge separation for the dissociating fragments
	are strongly coupled with the fluctuating solvent polarization, as
	represented by the time-dependent solvent field in the present model.
	The results of the calculations with varying time scales for the
	solvent response have demonstrated the possibility of numerous diverse
	phenomena resulting from nonadiabatic transitions. In particular,
	we found charge transfer induced by changing solvent polarization.
	The general model presented in the study provides a reasonable interpretation,
	at least on a qualitative level, for the interesting features obtained
	from recent experiments and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics studies
	on the photodissociation of I2 2 in molecular clusters.},

	role in generating the three different patterns. In this study we
	
	examined the characteristics of transient currents in DCN pyramidal
	
	cells to evaluate this hypothesis. Morphologically identified pyramidal
	
	cells in rat brain slices (P11-P17) exhibited the three voltage-dependent
	
	discharge patterns. Two inactivating currents were present in outside-out
	
	patches from pyramidal cells: a rapidly inactivating (IKIF, tau approximately
	
	11 msec) current insensitive to block by tetraethylammonium (TEA)
	
	and variably blocked by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) with half-inactivation
	
	near -85 mV, and a slowly inactivating TEA- and 4-AP-sensitive current
	
	(IKIS, tau approximately 145 msec) with half-inactivation near -35
	
	mV. Recovery from inactivation at 34 degrees C was described by a
	
	single exponential with a time constant of 10-30 msec, similar to
	
	the rate at which first spike latency increases with the duration
	
	of a hyperpolarizing prepulse. Acutely isolated cells also possessed
	
	a rapidly activating (<1 msec at 22 degrees C) transient current
	
	that activated near -45 mV and showed half-inactivation near -80
	
	mV. A model demonstrated that the deinactivation of IKIF was correlated
	
	with the discharge patterns. Overall, the properties of the fast
	
	inactivating K+ current were consistent with their proposed role

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Central neurocytoma (CN) represents a rare, relatively
	recently described primary central nervous system tumor. It ranks
	among intraventricular tumors due to its predominant location within
	the lateral brain ventricles. CN occurs mostly in young adults around
	the 3rd decade of life; almost a fifth of the cases are children
	under 18 years of age. OBJECTIVES: The authors present three cases
	of patients with histopathologically confirmed CN, emphasizing diagnostic
	imaging issues. A review of the literature concerning differential
	diagnosis and clinical and therapeutic aspects is also presented.
	CONCLUSION: Literature reports of CN comprise most likely case reports,
	small cohorts of patients, and meta-analytic studies due to the generally
	low incidence of this tumor. In the current paper, the authors summarize
	up-to-date knowledge of this rare disease on the background of their
	own observations. CN should be included in the list for differential
	diagnostics of intraventricular brain tumors, especially those located
	in lateral ventricles.},

	responses to sensory stimuli in vivo. It has remained unclear how
	this variability extends to population responses on a trial-to-trial
	basis. Here, we characterized single-neuron and population responses
	to whisker stimulation in layer 2/3 (L2/3) of identified columns
	in rat barrel cortex using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. Optical
	detection of single action potentials from evoked calcium transients
	revealed low spontaneous firing rates (0.25 Hz), variable response
	probabilities (range, 0-0.5; mean, 0.2 inside barrel column), and
	weak angular tuning of L2/3 neurons. On average, both the single-neuron
	response probability and the percentage of the local population activated
	were higher in the barrel column than above septa or in neighboring
	columns. Within the barrel column, mean response probability was
	highest in the center (0.4) and declined toward the barrel border.
	Neuronal pairs showed correlations in both spontaneous and sensory-evoked
	activity that depended on the location of the neurons. Correlation
	decreased with increasing distance between neurons and, for neuronal
	pairs the same distance apart, with distance of the pair from the
	barrel column center. Although neurons are therefore not activated
	independently from each other, we did not observe precisely repeating
	spatial activation patterns. Instead, population responses showed
	large trial-to-trial variability. Nevertheless, the accuracy of decoding
	stimulus onset times from local population activity increased with
	population size and depended on anatomical location. We conclude
	that, despite their sparseness and variability, L2/3 population responses
	show a clear spatial organization on the columnar scale.},

	loading with patch pipettes, cytoplasmic content is preserved following
	
	ballistic loading. This enables the study of calcium-dependent second

	chinchillas, with a noise level sufficient to damage the cochlea,
	
	led to cytological changes and degeneration of synaptic endings in
	
	the cochlear nucleus within 1-16 weeks. In the present study, the
	
	same stimulus was used to study the long-term effects on the fine
	
	structure of synaptic endings in the cochlear nucleus. For periods
	
	of 6 and 8 months after a single exposure to a damaging noise level,
	
	there ensued a chronic, continuing process of neurodegeneration involving
	
	excitatory and inhibitory synaptic endings. Electron microscopic
	
	observations demonstrated freshly occurring degeneration even as
	
	late as 8 months. Degeneration was widespread in the neuropil and
	
	included the synapses on the globular bushy cell, which forms part
	
	of the main ascending auditory pathway. Neurodegeneration was accompanied
	
	by newly formed synaptic endings, which repopulated some of the sites
	
	vacated previously by axosomatic endings on globular bushy cells.
	
	Many of these synaptic endings must arise from central interneurons.
	
	The findings suggest that overstimulation can induce a self-sustaining
	
	condition of progressive neurodegeneration accompanied by a new growth
	
	of synaptic endings. Noise-induced hearing loss thus may progress
	
	as a neurodegenerative disease with the capacity for synaptic reorganization

	evidence indicates functional linkage between some of the pairs of
	sites with high mutual information. Further specific mutational studies
	of the V3 loop's role in determining viral phenotype are suggested

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Mercury and most of its compounds are extremely toxic
	and should be handled with care. It can be inhaled and absorbed through
	the skin and mucous membranes. The most toxic forms of mercury are
	its organic compounds such as dimethylmercury and methylmercury.
	Fish have a natural tendency to accumulate mercury. Methylmercury
	is produced by microbial methylation of inorganic mercury in water
	sediment then it infiltrates the food chain and it consequently accumulates
	in fish. Fish are the main source of methylmercury in human food.
	Mercury is transferred into a hair; and this can be than used to
	monitor the long-term exposure to mercury. The content of mercury
	in hair depends on the frequency of fish consumption. The aim of
	our study was to compare mercury content in the hair of children
	that had various amounts of fish consumption (increased or reduced).
	DESIGN: Total mercury content in hair was determined by direct method
	of cold vapors using an AMA 245 analyzer. A total of 174 hair samples
	from the children (9-17 years old) were analyzed. In this study,
	the following localities were compared: Neratovice (n=42), Jeseníky
	(n=44), Prague (n=59) in Czech Republic and Olsztyn in Poland (n=29).
	Every sample was accompanied with questionnaire about age, gender,
	regions, amalgam fillings and fish consumption. RESULTS: We did not
	find a correlation between the content of mercury in hair with age,
	gender or amalgam fillings. We did find a correlation between fish
	consumption and the amount of mercury found in the hair samples.
	CONCLUSION: The amount of mercury in hair increases with more frequent
	consumption of freshwater and marine fish.},

	modification of the heat treatment was performed using healthy and
	melanoma-bearing splenocytes. We found a 40 \% increase of activated
	monocytes (CD11b+CD69+) infiltration into the tumor microenvironment.
	In the spleen of experimental animals, the numbers of cytotoxic T
	lymphocytes (CTLs-CD3+CD8+) and NK cell (CD49b+NK1.1+) raised by
	22 \% and 14 \%, respectively, while the NK1.1+ monocytes decreases

	measurement of the spiking activity of many neurons. Analysis of
	
	such multineuronal data is one of the key challenge in computational
	
	neuroscience today. In this work, we develop a multivariate point-process
	
	model in which the observed activity of a network of neurons depends
	
	on three terms: (1) the experimentally-controlled stimulus; (2) the
	
	spiking history of the observed neurons; and (3) a hidden term that
	
	corresponds, for example, to common input from an unobserved population
	
	of neurons that is presynaptic to two or more cells in the observed
	
	population. We consider two models for the network firing-rates,
	
	one of which is computationally and analytically tractable but can
	
	lead to unrealistically high firing-rates, while the other with reasonable
	
	firing-rates imposes a greater computational burden. We develop an
	
	expectation-maximization algorithm for fitting the parameters of
	
	both the models. For the analytically tractable model the expectation
	
	step is based on a continuous-time implementation of the extended
	
	Kalman smoother, and the maximization step involves two concave maximization
	
	problems which may be solved in parallel. The other model that we
	
	consider necessitates the use of Monte Carlo methods for the expectation
	
	as well as maximization step. We discuss the trade-off involved in
	
	choosing between the two models and the associated methods. The techniques
	
	developed allow us to solve a variety of inference problems in a
	
	straightforward, computationally efficient fashion; for example,
	
	we may use the model to predict network activity given an arbitrary
	
	stimulus, infer a neuron's ring rate given the stimulus and the activity
	
	of the other observed neurons, and perform optimal stimulus decoding
	
	and prediction. We present several detailed simulation studies which
	
	explore the strengths and limitations of our approach.},

  abstract = {RNA silencing is a common term for a group of mechanistically related
	pathways that produce and employ short non-coding RNA molecules to
	achieve sequence-specific gene regulation. The RNase III-enzyme Dicer
	produces small RNAs (smRNAs) in both microRNA (miRNA) and RNA interference
	(RNAi) pathways. miRNAs modulate physiological and developmental
	gene expression. They are genome-encoded, endogenous negative regulators
	of translation and mRNA stability originating from long primary transcripts
	with local hairpin structures. RNAi is triggered by the processing
	of long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs),
	which mediate sequence-specific cleavage of nascent mRNAs. The third
	common class of repressive small RNAs, PIWI-associated RNAs (piRNAs),
	is produced in a Dicer-independent manner. Current data suggest that
	piRNAs protect the germline from mobile genome invaders such as transposons.
	A small RNA involved in RNA silencing associates with proteins in
	an effector ribonucleoprotein complex usually referred to as RNA-Induced
	Silencing Complex (RISC). Key components of RISC complexes are proteins

	paleocortex, which is retained in present-day reptiles such as the
	turtle. Thus the turtle offers an opportunity to examine which cellular
	and circuit properties are fundamental to cortical function. We characterized
	the dendritic properties of pyramidal neurons in different cortical
	regions of mature turtles, Pseudemys scripta elegans, using whole
	cell recordings and calcium imaging from the axon, soma, and dendrites
	in a slice preparation. The firing properties, in response to intrasomatic
	depolarization, resembled those previously recorded with sharp electrodes
	in this preparation. Somatic spikes led to active backpropagating
	high-amplitude dendritic action potentials and intracellular calcium
	ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) changes at all dendritic locations, suggesting
	that both backpropagation and dendritic voltage-gated Ca2+ channels
	are primitive traits. We found no indication that Ca2+ spikes could
	be evoked in the dendrites, but fast Na+ spikes could be initiated
	there following intradendritic stimulation. Several lines of evidence
	indicate that fast, smaller-amplitude somatic spikes ("prepotentials")
	that are easily recorded in this preparation are generated in the
	axon. Most synaptically activated [Ca2+]i changes resulted from Ca2+
	entry through voltage-gated channels. In some cells synaptic stimulation
	evoked a delayed Ca2+ wave due to release from internal stores following
	activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. With some small differences
	these properties resemble those of pyramidal neurons in mammalian
	species. We conclude that spike backpropagation, dendritic Ca2+ channels,
	and synaptically activated Ca2+ release are primitive and conserved
	features of cortical pyramidal cells, and therefore likely fundamental
	to cortical function.}

	that the precise cochleotopic organization of the central nucleus
	
	(ICC) develops normally in neonatally deafened unstimulated cats
	
	and is unaltered despite the lack of normal auditory input during
	
	development. However, these studies also showed that chronic electrical
	
	stimulation delivered at a single intracochlear location by one bipolar
	
	channel of a cochlear implant induces significant expansion of the
	
	central representation of the stimulated cochlear sector and degrades
	
	the cochleotopic organization of the IC. This report presents additional
	
	data from a new experimental series of neonatally deafened cats that
	
	received chronic stimulation on two adjacent bipolar intracochlear
	
	channels of a cochlear implant. Results suggest that competing inputs
	
	elicited by electrical stimulation delivered by two adjacent channels
	
	can maintain the selective representations of each activated cochlear
	
	sector within the central auditory system and prevent the expansion
	
	seen after single-channel stimulation. Alternating stimulation of
	
	two channels and use of highly controlled electrical signals may
	
	be particularly effective in maintaining or even sharpening selectivity
	
	of central representations of stimulated cochlear sectors. In contrast,
	
	simultaneous stimulation using two channels of a model analog cochlear
	
	implant processor in one experimental animal failed to maintain channel
	
	selectivity and resulted in marked expansion and fusion of the central
	
	representations of the stimulated channels. This potentially important
	
	preliminary result suggests that under some conditions the central

	Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other

	lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive,

	is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge

  abstract = {When computing descriptors of image data, the type of information
	that can be extracted may be strongly dependent on the scales at
	which the image operators are applied. This article presents a systematic
	methodology for addressing this problem. A mechanism is presented
	for automatic selection of scale levels when detecting one-dimensional
	image features, such as edges and ridges. A novel concept of a scale-space
	edge is introduced, defined as a connected set of points in scale-space
	at which: (i) the gradient magnitude a ssumes a local maximum in
	the gradient direction, and (ii) a normalized measure of the strength
	of the edge response is locally maximal over scales. An important
	consequence of this defi nition is that it allows the scale levels
	to vary along the edge. Two specific measures of edge strength are
	analysed in detail, the gradient magnitude and a differential expression
	derived from the third-order derivative in the gradient direction.
	For a certain way of normalizing these differential descriptors,
	by expressing them in terms of so-called -normalized derivatives,
	an immediate consequence of this deffnition is that the edge detector
	will adapt its scale levels to the local image structure. Specifically,
	sharp edges will be detected at scales so as to reduce the shape
	distortions due to scale-space smoothing, whereas sufficiently coarse
	scales will be selected at diffuse edges, such that an edge model
	is a valid abstraction of the intensity profile across the edge.
	Since the scale-space edge is defined from the intersection of two
	zero-crossing surfaces in scale-space, the edges will by definition
	form closed curves. This simplified selection of salient edges, and
	a novel significance measure is proposed, by integrating the edge
	strength along the edge. Moreover, the scale information associated
	with each edge provides useful clues to the physical nature of the
	edge. With just slight modifications, similar ideas can be used for
	formulating ridge detectors with automatic selection, having the
	characteristic property that the selected scales on a scale-space
	ridge instead reject the width of the ridge. It is shown how the
	methodology can be implemented in terms of straightforward visual
	front-end operations, and the validity of the approach is supported
	by theoretical analysis as well as experiments on real-world and
	synthetic data. Keywords: edge detection, ridge detection, scale
	selection, diffuseness, normalized derivative, Gaussian derivative,

	directly with each other forming junctions. It is possible that some
	links are absent. Instead of solving the diffusion equation for the

	efficient. We derived a set of rate equations that govern the time
	dependence of the number of particles in each container N1(t),N2(t),
	. . . ,NM(t). In such a way the complicated transport problem is
	reduced to a set of M first order integro-differential equations

	here. The rate equations are valid for any network topology under
	the assumption that the tubes are thin in comparison to their lengths
	and the radii of the containers, aij â‰ª Ri,Rj , lij . Under these
	assumptions the containers can be considered ideally mixed at all

	simple networks with relatively few containers exhibit interesting
	transport behavior. For example, we showed that it is possible to
	adjust the geometry of the networks so that the particle concentration
	varies in time in a wave-like manner. Such behavior deviates from
	simple exponential growth and decay occurring in the two container
	system. In addition, we showed how to eliminate junctions from the

	antibodies specific to the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal regions
	of DMP1 and confocal microscopy. In rat first molar organs, the NH2-terminal
	fragment localized to predentin, whereas the COOH-terminal fragment
	was mainly restricted to mineralized dentin. In the growth plate
	of bone, the NH2-terminal fragment appeared in the proliferation
	and hypertrophic zones, whereas the COOH-terminal fragment occupied
	the ossification zone. Forster resonance energy transfer analysis
	showed colocalization of both fragments of DMP1 in odontoblasts and
	predentin, as well as hypertrophic chondrocytes within the growth
	plates of bone. The biochemical analysis of bovine teeth showed that
	predentin is rich in DMP1-PG, whereas mineralized dentin primarily
	contains the COOH-terminal fragment. We conclude that the differential
	patterns of expression of NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal fragments
	of DMP1 reflect their potentially distinct roles in the biomineralization
	of dentin and bone matrices.},

  abstract = {Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) has been shown to be critical for the
	formation of dentin and bone. However, the precise pathway by which
	DMP1 participates in dentinogenesis and osteogenesis remains to be
	clarified. DMP1 is present in the extracellular matrix of dentin
	and bone as processed NH(2)- and COOH-terminal fragments. The NH(2)-terminal
	fragment occurs as a proteoglycan, whereas the COOH-terminal fragment
	is highly phosphorylated. The differences in biochemical properties
	suggest that these fragments may have different tissue and cell distribution
	in association with distinct functions. In this study, we analyzed
	the distribution of the NH(2)- and COOH-terminal fragments of DMP1
	in tooth, bone, osteocytes as well as MC3T3-E1 and HEK-293 cells.
	Immunohistochemical analyses were performed using antibodies specific
	to the NH(2)- or COOH-terminal region of DMP1. Clear differences
	in the distribution of these fragments were observed. In the teeth
	and bone, the NH(2)-terminal fragment was primarily located in the
	nonmineralized predentin and cartilage of the growth plate, while
	the COOH-terminal fragment accumulated in the mineralized zones.
	In osteocytes, the NH(2)-terminal fragment appeared more abundant
	along cell membrane and processes of osteocytes, while the COOH-terminal
	fragment was often found in the nuclei. This pattern of distribution
	in cellular compartments was further confirmed by analyses on MC3T3-E1
	and HEK-293 cells transfected with a construct containing DMP1 cDNA.
	In these cell lines, the COOH-terminal fragment accumulated in cell
	nuclei, while the NH(2)-terminal fragment was in the cytosol. The
	different distribution of DMP1 fragments indicates that these DMP1
	variants must perform distinct functions.},

  abstract = {Although plastic changes are known to occur in developing and adult
	
	cortex, it remains unclear whether these changes require remodeling
	
	of cortical circuitry whereby synapses are formed and eliminated
	
	or whether they rely on changes in the strength of existing synapses.
	
	To determine the structural stability of dendritic spines and axon
	
	terminals in vivo, we chose two approaches. First, we performed time-lapse
	
	two-photon imaging of dendritic spine motility of layer 5 pyramidal
	
	neurons in juvenile [postnatal day 28 (P28)] mice in visual, auditory,
	
	and somatosensory cortices. We found that there were differences
	
	in basal rates of dendritic spine motility of the same neuron type
	
	in different cortices, with visual cortex exhibiting the least structural
	
	dynamics. Rewiring visual input into the auditory cortex at birth,
	
	however, failed to alter dendritic spine motility, suggesting that
	
	structural plasticity rates might be intrinsic to the cortical region.
	
	Second, we investigated the persistence of both the presynaptic (axon
	
	terminals) and postsynaptic (dendritic spine) structures in young
	
	adult mice (P40-P61), using chronic in vivo two-photon imaging in
	
	different sensory areas. Both terminals and spines were relatively
	
	stable, with >80\% persisting over a 3 week period in all sensory
	
	regions. Axon terminals were more stable than dendritic spines. These
	
	data suggest that changes in network function during adult learning
	
	and memory might occur through changes in the strength and efficacy
	
	of existing synapses as well as some remodeling of connectivity through
	
	the loss and gain of synapses.},

	potentials were observed: simple spikes and complex spikes. This
	
	report discusses only cells with simple spikes. Simple spiking cells
	
	(60/72 recorded cells; all stained cells were simple spiking cells)
	
	discharged in a regular fashion with depolarization, and had linear
	
	frequency-current relationships up to 2 nA with a mean slope of 116
	
	Hz/nA. The discharge rate was approximately constant throughout the
	
	current pulse. Responses of simple spiking cells to depolarizing
	
	current steps superimposed on a steady-state membrane hyperpolarization
	
	were studied. When the membrane has been held hyperpolarized, small
	
	current pulses produce a long-latency regular train of action potentials.
	
	Larger current pulses superimposed on membrane hyperpolarization
	
	can produce a short-latency action potential followed by a long silent
	
	interval (i.e., a long first interspike interval), and finally a
	
	regular train of spikes. It is concluded that the membrane conductances

	patterns (regular firing, long first spike latency, and long first
	
	interspike interval) depending on the state of the membrane potential
	
	prior to a depolarizing current step. These responses are similar
	
	to the "chopper," "buildup," and "pauser" discharge patterns reported
	
	for these cells in vivo in response to tone bursts. The modulation
	
	of the intrinsic membrane conductances by membrane polarization and
	
	the possible contribution of these conductances to the generation

	underlying the responses of DCN cells to acoustic stimuli.},

	discharged a series of two or three action potentials riding on a

	cells were stained with intracellular dyes and subsequently identified

	cells recorded in concurrent experiments were pyramidal cells. The

	by spiny dendrites penetrating the molecular layer, a lack of basal

	synaptic contacts at the light microscopic level with pyramidal cells

	over time. At present, there are no techniques that allow reliable
	monitoring of changes within identified neurons over repeated experimental
	sessions. We increased the signal strength of troponin C-based calcium
	biosensors in the low-calcium regime by mutagenesis and domain rearrangement
	within the troponin C calcium binding moiety to generate the indicator
	TN-XXL. Using in vivo two-photon ratiometric imaging, we show that
	TN-XXL exhibits enhanced fluorescence changes in neurons of flies
	and mice. TN-XXL could be used to obtain tuning curves of orientation-selective
	neurons in mouse visual cortex measured repeatedly over days and
	weeks. Thus, the genetically encoded calcium indicator TN-XXL allows
	repeated imaging of response properties from individual, identified
	neurons in vivo, which will be crucial for gaining new insights into
	cellular mechanisms of plasticity, regeneration and disease.},

	new genetically-encoded calcium indicator-GCaMP2-in mammalian pyramidal

	robust responses (302+/-50\% for trains of 40 action potentials at

	electroporated mice, indicating that long-term expression did not
	interfere with GCaMP2 function. Membrane-targeted versions of GCaMP2
	did not yield larger signals than their non-targeted counterparts.
	We further targeted GCaMP2 to dendritic spines to monitor Ca(2+)
	accumulations evoked by activation of synaptic NMDA receptors. We
	observed robust DeltaF/F responses (range: 37\%-264\%) to single
	spine uncaging stimuli that were correlated with NMDA receptor currents
	measured through a somatic patch pipette. One major drawback of GCaMP2

	improved from the previous versions of GCaMP and may be suited to
	detect bursts of high-frequency action potentials and synaptic currents

  abstract = {A set of cosmological variables, which we shall refer to as ï¾‘supercomoving
	variablesï¾’, are presented which are an alternative to the standard
	comoving variables, particularly useful for describing the gas dynamics
	of cosmic structure formation. For an ideal gas with a ratio of specific
	heats g Â¼ 5=3, the supercomoving position, velocity and thermodynamic
	properties (i.e. density, temperature and pressure) of matter are
	constant in time in a uniform, isotropic, adiabatically expanding
	universe. Expressed in terms of these supercomoving variables, the
	non-relativistic, cosmological fluid conservation equations of the
	Newtonian approximation and the Poisson equation closely resemble
	their non-cosmological counterparts. This makes it possible to generalize
	non-cosmological results and techniques to address problems involving
	departures from uniform, adiabatic Hubble expansion in a straightforward
	way, for a wide range of cosmological models. These variables were
	initially introduced by Shandarin to describe structure formation
	in matter-dominated models. In this paper, we generalize supercomoving
	variables to models with a uniform contribution to the energy density
	corresponding to a non-zero cosmological constant, domain walls,
	cosmic strings, a nonclumping form of non-relativistic matter (e.g.
	massive neutrinos in the presence of primordial density fluctuations
	of small wavelength) or a radiation background. Each model is characterized
	by the value of the density parameter Q0 of the non-relativistic
	matter component in which density fluctuation is possible, and the
	density parameter QX0 of the additional nonclumping component. For
	each type of non-clumping background, we identify families within
	which different values of Q0 and QX0 lead to fluid equations and
	solutions in supercomoving variables which are independent of the
	cosmological parameters Q0 and QX0. We also generalize the description
	to include the effects of non-adiabatic processes such as heating,
	radiative cooling, thermal conduction and viscosity, as well as magnetic
	fields in the MHD approximation. As an illustration, we describe
	three familiar cosmological problems in supercomoving variables:
	the growth of linear density fluctuations, the non-linear collapse
	of a 1D plane-wave density fluctuation leading to pancake formation,
	and the well-known Zelï¾’dovich approximation for extrapolating the
	linear growth of density fluctuations in three dimensions to the
	non-linear stage.},

	liquid nitrogen, has been developed. The conditions for separation

	The limits of detection for methylated arsenicals tested were 4 ng

	The arsines are generated either exclusively from trivalent or from
	both tri- and pentavalent inorganic and methylated arsenicals depending

	A TRIS buffer reaction medium is proposed to overcome narrow optimum
	concentration range observed for the L-cysteine modified reaction

  abstract = {Zebrafish embryos exhibit spontaneous contractions of the musculature
	as early as 18-19 h post fertilization (hpf) when removed from their
	protective chorion. These movements are likely initiated by early
	embryonic central nervous system activity. We have made the observation
	that narrowminded mutant embryos (hereafter, nrd(-/-)) lack normal
	embryonic motor output upon dechorionation. However, these mutants
	can swim and respond to tactile stimulation by larval stages of development.
	nrd(-/-) embryos exhibit defects in neural crest development, slow
	muscle development and also lack spinal mechanosensory neurons known
	as Rohon-Beard (RB) neurons. At early developmental stages (i.e.
	21-22 hpf) and while still in their chorions, nrd siblings (nrd(+/?))
	exhibited contractions of the musculature at a rate similar to wild-type
	embryos. Anatomical analysis indicated that RB neurons were present
	in the motile embryos, but absent in the non-motile embryos, indicating
	that the non-motile embryos were nrd(-/-) embryos. Further anatomical
	analysis of nrd(-/-) embryos revealed errors in motoneuron axonal
	pathfinding that persisted into the larval stage of development.
	These errors were reversed when nrd(-/-) embryos were raised in high
	[K(+)] beginning at 21 hpf, indicating that the abnormal axonal phenotypes
	may be related to a lack of depolarizing activity early in development.
	When activity was blocked with tricaine in wild-type embryos, motoneuron
	phenotypes were similar to the motoneuron phenotypes in nrd(-/-)
	embryos. These results implicate early embryonic activity in conjunction
	with other factors as necessary for normal motoneuron development.},

	are in large part based on the integration of electrical and calcium
	signals that takes place in thin dendritic branches of neocortical
	pyramidal cells (synaptic integration). The mechanisms underlying
	the synaptic integration in thin basal dendrites are largely unexplored.
	We use a recently developed technique, multisite voltage-calcium
	imaging, to compare voltage and calcium transients from multiple
	locations along individual dendritic branches. Our results reveal
	characteristic electrical transients (plateau potentials) that trigger
	and shape dendritic calcium dynamics and calcium distribution during
	suprathreshold glutamatergic synaptic input. We regularly observed
	three classes of voltage-calcium interactions occurring simultaneously
	in three different zones of the same dendritic branch: (1) proximal
	to the input site, (2) at the input site, and (3) distal to the input
	site. One hundred micrometers away from the synaptic input site,
	both proximally and distally, dendritic calcium transients are in
	tight temporal correlation with the dendritic plateau potential.
	However, on the same dendrite, at the location of excitatory input,
	calcium transients outlast local dendritic plateau potentials by
	severalfold. These Ca2+ plateaus (duration 0.5-2 s) are spatially
	restricted to the synaptic input site, where they cause a brief down-regulation
	of dendritic excitability. Ca2+ plateaus are not mediated by Ca2+
	release from intracellular stores, but rather by an NMDA-dependent
	small-amplitude depolarization, which persists after the collapse
	of the dendritic plateau potential. These unique features of dendritic
	voltage and calcium distributions may provide distinct zones for
	simultaneous long-term (bidirectional) modulation of synaptic contacts
	along the same basal branch. },

	Such reconstructions require 3D segmentation of individual neuronal

	Our approach makes possible reconstructions of neural tissue at final

	of proofreading. To date we have applied this approach to reconstruct
	few blocks of neural tissue from different regions of rat brain totaling

	the utility of a frequency-based representation, with short, moving

	death of cochlear inner hair cells (IHC). Additional degeneration

	of the system, which may produce excitotoxicity. This study tested
	
	these predictions by exposing one ear of anesthetized adult chinchillas
	
	to a loud noise, which damaged the ipsilateral cochlea and induced
	
	degeneration in the glutamatergic cochlear nerve. During the first
	
	postexposure week, before cochlear nerve axons degenerated, glutamatergic
	
	synaptic release in the ipsilateral CN was elevated and uptake was
	
	depressed, consistent with hyperactivity of glutamatergic transmission
	
	and perhaps with the operation of an excitotoxic mechanism. By 14
	
	days, when cochlear nerve fibers degenerated, glutamatergic synaptic
	
	release and uptake in the CN became deficient. By 90 days, a resurgence
	
	of transmitter release and an elevation of AMPA receptor binding
	
	suggested transmission upregulation through plasticity that resembled
	
	changes after mechanical cochlear damage. These changes may contribute
	
	to tinnitus and other pathologic symptoms that precede and accompany
	
	hearing loss. In contrast, the other ear, protected with a silicone
	
	plug during the noise exposure, exhibited virtually no damage in
	
	the cochlea or the cochlear nerve. Altered glutamatergic release

	portions had been interchanged and reconnected by a short spacer
	
	between the original termini. The cpGFP was fused to calmodulin and
	
	its target peptide, M13. The chimeric protein, which we have named
	
	"pericam," was fluorescent and its spectral properties changed reversibly
	
	with the amount of {Ca}$^{2+}$, probably because of the interaction
	
	between calmodulin and M13 leading to an alteration of the environment
	
	surrounding the chromophore. Three types of pericam were obtained
	
	by mutating several amino acids adjacent to the chromophore. Of these,
	
	"flash-pericam" became brighter with {Ca}$^{2+}$, whereas "inverse-pericam"
	
	dimmed. On the other hand, "ratiometric-pericam" had an excitation
	
	wavelength changing in a {Ca}$^{2+}$-dependent manner. All of the
	
	pericams expressed in HeLa cells were able to monitor free {Ca}$^{2+}$
	
	dynamics, such as {Ca}$^{2+}$ oscillations in the cytosol and the

	measured by using ratiometric-pericams having appropriate localization
	
	signals, revealing that extra-mitochondrial {Ca}$^{2+}$ transients
	
	caused rapid changes in the concentration of mitochondrial {Ca}$^{2+}$.
	
	Finally, a "split-pericam" was made by deleting the linker in the
	
	flash-pericam. The {Ca}$^{2+}$-dependent interaction between calmodulin

	probes are difficult to use because of a low signal-to-noise ratio.
	
	Here we report the development of a high-affinity Ca(2+) probe composed
	
	of a single GFP (named G-CaMP). G-CaMP showed an apparent K(d) for
	
	Ca(2+) of 235 nM. Association kinetics of Ca(2+) binding were faster
	
	at higher Ca(2+) concentrations, with time constants decreasing from
	
	230 ms at 0.2 microM Ca(2+) to 2.5 ms at 1 microM Ca(2+). Dissociation
	
	kinetics (tau approximately 200 ms) are independent of Ca(2+) concentrations.
	
	In HEK-293 cells and mouse myotubes expressing G-CaMP, large fluorescent
	
	changes were observed in response to application of drugs or electrical
	
	stimulations. G-CaMP will be a useful tool for visualizing intracellular
	
	Ca2+ in living cells. Mutational analysis, together with previous
	
	structural information, suggests the residues that may alter the
	
	fluorescence of GFP.},

  note = {This paper provides relatively clear proof-by-construction of approximate
	version of Kolmogorov theorem, which states that any n-dimensional
	function can be represented as a sum of 2n+1 1D functions of sums
	of n fixed functions with different coefficients (total of n+1 parameters).
	In nut-shell, Kolmogorov theorem is analog of the statement that
	any function of n-dimensional index Z^n is isomorphic to a function
	of 1D index via Z^n->Z. In general, simple index mapping Z^n->Z is
	not continuous as step-discontinuities arise along each "line" of
	the mapping. Kolmogorov's achievement was to provide a construction
	which contribute a continuous map [0,1]^n->[0,1]. Such mapping is
	constructed by finding families of 2n+1 coverings of n-cube of decreasing
	diameter and vanishing overlaps within each family such that each
	point is covered by at least n+1 cubes from these coverings. One
	then is able to construct continuous functions that map each of such
	cubes non-overlaping cubes into distinct points of the [0,1] line
	(!). Therefore, [0,1]^n is continuously mapped 1-1 onto [0,1] and
	any continuous function of [0,1]^n can be seen as (some) continuous
	function of the image of [0,1]^n. Some subtleties are present requiring
	2n+1 such functions each approximating on a subset of n coverings
	at a time. Note that dimensionality curse is not removed since complexity
	of R^n space is translated into extremely complex mapping into R,
	and thus, generally, no gain is achieved for actual interpolation.},
  abstract = {In this paper, we prove constructively two approximative versions
	of the superposition theorem of Kolmogorov (19631, corresponding
	to Lorentz (1962) and Sprecher (1965). The proofs are constructive
	in the sense that only rationals, expressible as finite decimal sums,
	are used. The approximations consist in algorithms with error bounds.
	Concerning their complexity, the two results differ in the way the
	occurring sequences are constructed: recursively, respectively explicitly.},

  abstract = {1. Digital imaging and photometry were used in conjunction with the
	
	fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, Fura-2, to examine intracellular Ca2+
	
	signals produced by depolarization of single adrenal chromaffin cells.
	
	2. Depolarization with a patch pipette produced radial gradients
	
	of Ca2+ within the cell, with Ca2+ concentration highest in the vicinity
	
	of the plasma membrane. These gradients dissipated within a few hundred
	
	milliseconds when the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels were closed. 3.
	
	Dialysis of Fura-2 into the chromaffin cell caused concentration-dependent
	
	changes in the depolarization-induced Ca2+ signal, decreasing its
	
	magnitude and slowing its recovery time course. These changes were
	
	used to estimate the properties of the endogenous cytoplasmic Ca2+
	
	buffer with which Fura-2 competes for Ca2+. 4. The spatially averaged
	
	Fura-2 signal was well described by a model assuming fast competition
	
	between Fura-2 and an endogenous buffer on a millisecond time scale.
	
	Retrieval of calcium by pumps and slow buffers occurs on a seconds-long
	
	time scale. No temporal changes indicative of buffers with intermediate
	
	kinetics could be detected. 5. Two independent estimates of the capacity
	
	of the fast endogenous Ca2+ buffer suggest that 98-99\% of the Ca2+
	
	entering the cell normally is taken up by this buffer. This buffer
	
	appears to be immobile, because it does not wash out of the cell
	
	during dialysis. It has a low affinity for Ca2+ ions, because it
	
	does not saturate with 1 microM-Ca2+ inside the cell. 6. The low
	
	capacity, affinity and mobility of the endogenous Ca2+ buffer makes
	
	it possible for relatively small amounts of exogenous Ca2+ buffers,
	
	such as Fura-2, to exert a significant influence on the characteristics
	
	of the Ca2+ concentration signal as measured by fluorescence ratios.
	
	On the other hand, even at moderate Fura-2 concentrations (0.4 mM)
	
	Fura-2 will dominate over the endogenous buffers. Under these conditions
	
	radiometric Ca2+ concentration signals are largely attenuated, but
	
	absolute fluorescence changes (at 390 nm) accurately reflect calcium
	
	fluxes.},

	we demonstrate the use of single-cell electroporation for {Ca}$^{2+}$
	
	indicator loading of individual neurons and small neuronal networks
	
	in rat neocortex in vitro and in vivo. Brief voltage pulses were
	
	delivered through glass pipettes positioned close to target cells.
	
	This approach resulted in reliable and rapid (within seconds) loading
	
	of somata and subsequent complete labeling of dendritic and axonal
	
	arborizations. By using simultaneous whole-cell recordings in brain
	
	slices, we directly addressed the effect of electroporation on neurons.
	
	Cell viability was high (about 85\%) with recovery from the membrane
	
	permeabilization occurring within a minute. Electrical properties
	
	of recovered cells were indistinguishable before and after electroporation.
	
	In addition, {Ca}$^{2+}$ transients with normal appearance could
	
	be evoked in dendrites, spines, and axonal boutons of electroporated
	
	cells. Using negative-stains of somata, targeted single-cell electroporation
	
	was equally applicable in vivo. We conclude that electroporation
	
	is a simple approach that permits {Ca}$^{2+}$ indicator loading of
	
	multiple cells with low background staining within a short amount
	
	of time, which makes it especially well suited for functional imaging

	a "scanless" microscope that does not contain mechanically moving

	(SLM) to shape an incoming two-photon laser beam into any arbitrary
	light pattern. This allows the simultaneous imaging or photostimulation
	of different regions of a sample with three-dimensional precision.
	To demonstrate the usefulness of this microscope, we perform two-photon
	uncaging of glutamate to activate dendritic spines and cortical neurons
	in brain slices. We also use it to carry out fast (60 Hz) two-photon
	calcium imaging of action potentials in neuronal populations. Thus,
	SLM microscopy appears to be a powerful tool for imaging and optically
	manipulating neurons and neuronal circuits. Moreover, the use of
	SLMs expands the flexibility of laser microscopy, as it can substitute

	contouring of 2D imaging scans is still extensively used. Our proposed
	method is based on a mor- phing process applied to neighboring contours
	that sweeps out a 3D surface. Our method is guaranteed to produce
	closed surfaces that exactly pass through the input contours, regardless
	of the topology of the reconstruction. Our general approach consecutively
	morphs between sets of input contours using an Eulerian formulation
	(i.e. Â¯xed grid) augmented with Lagrangian particles (i.e. interface
	track- ing). This is numerically accomplished by propagating the
	input contours as 2D level sets with carefully constructed continuous
	speed functions. SpeciÂ¯cally this involves parti- cle advection
	to estimate distances between the contours, monotonicity constrained
	spline interpolation to compute continuous speed functions without
	overshooting, and state- of-the-art numerical techniques for solving
	the level set equa- tions. We demonstrate the robustness of our method
	on a variety of medical, topographic and synthetic data sets.},

	to 12 months later, the inferior colliculus (IC) was examined physiologically

	congenital deafness. We investigated the properties of synaptic transmission
	
	in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) of normal and congenitally
	
	deaf dn/dn mice. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were evoked
	
	by focal stimulation of single auditory nerve fibres, and measured
	
	by whole-cell recordings from neurones in AVCN slices (mean postnatal
	
	age = P13). Absolute amplitudes of both AMPA- and NMDA-mediated components
	
	of evoked EPSCs were greater (170 \%) in deaf versus control animals.
	
	Enhanced transmission in deaf mice was due to a presynaptic mechanism.
	
	Variance-mean analysis revealed that the probability of transmitter
	
	release was significantly greater in deaf (P(r) = 0.8) versus control
	
	animals (P(r) = 0.5). Following high frequency stimulation, deaf
	
	mice showed a greater depression of evoked EPSCs, and a significant
	
	increase in the frequency of delayed-release (asynchronous) miniature
	
	EPSCs (aEPSCs) (deaf 100 Hz vs. control 7 Hz). The acetoxymethyl
	
	ester of EGTA (EGTA-AM) blocked the increase in miniature aEPSCs
	
	and returned tetanic depression to control values. In deaf mice,
	
	reduction of mean P(r) using cadmium caused an expected increase
	
	in paired-pulse ratio (PPR). However, in the same cells, a similar
	
	reduction in release by EGTA-AM did not result in a change in PPR,
	
	demonstrating that a change may occur in P(r) without a concomitant
	
	change in PPR. In many respects, transmission in deaf mice was found
	
	to be remarkably similar to control mice, implying that many parameters
	
	of synaptic transmission develop normally in these animals. The two
	
	significant differences (higher P(r) and asynchronous release in
	
	deaf mice) could both be reversed by the addition of EGTA-AM, suggesting
	
	that endogenous calcium buffering may be impaired or undeveloped

  abstract = {The chief inhibitory neurons of the mammalian brain, GABAergic neurons,
	are comprised of a myriad of diverse neuronal subtypes. To facilitate
	the study of these neurons, transgenic mice were generated that express
	enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in subpopulations of GABAergic
	neurons. In one of the resulting transgenic lines, called GIN (GFP-expressing
	Inhibitory Neurons), EGFP was found to be expressed in a subpopulation
	of somatostatin-containing GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus
	and neocortex. In both live and fixed brain preparations from these
	mice, detailed microanatomical features of EGFP-expressing interneurons
	were readily observed. In stratum oriens of the hippocampus, EGFP-expressing
	interneurons were comprised almost exclusively of oriens/alveus interneurons
	with lacunosum-moleculare axon arborization (O-LM cells). In the
	neocortex, the somata of EGFP-expressing interneurons were largely
	restricted to layers II-IV and upper layer V. In hippocampal area
	CA1, two previously uncharacterized subtypes of interneurons were
	identified using the GIN mice: stratum pyramidale interneurons with
	lacunosum-moleculare axon arborization (P-LM cells) and stratum radiatum
	interneurons with lacunosum-moleculare axon arborization (R-LM cells).
	These newly identified interneuronal subtypes appeared to be closely
	related to O-LM cell, as they selectively innervate stratum lacunosum-moleculare.
	Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that these cells were
	fast-spiking and showed virtually no spike frequency accommodation.
	The microanatomical features of these cells suggest that they function
	primarily as "input-biasing" neurons, in that synaptic volleys in
	stratum radiatum would lead to their activation, which in turn would
	result in selective suppression of excitatory input from the entorhinal
	cortex onto CA1 pyramidal cells.},

	where the two receptors share the same signaling cascade, such as

	Ca(2+) responses and the process of desensitization in HEK-293 cells,
	which express endogenous ANG II receptors. These cells were transfected
	to express exogenously high levels of TRH receptors (clone E2) or

	that the characteristics of the Ca(2+) response, as well as the process
	of desensitization, were both strongly dependent on receptor number
	and G(11)alpha protein level. Whereas treatment of E2 cells with
	TRH or ANG II led to significant desensitization of the Ca(2+) response
	to subsequent addition of either hormone, the response was not desensitized
	in E2M11 cells expressing high levels of G(11)alpha. In addition,
	stimulation of both cell lines with THR elicited a clear heterologous
	desensitization to subsequent stimulation with ANG II. On the other
	hand, ANG II did not affect a subsequent response to TRH. ANG II-mediated
	signal transduction was strongly dependent on plasma membrane integrity
	modified by cholesterol depletion, but signaling through TRH receptors
	was altered only slightly under these conditions. It may be concluded
	that the level of expression of G-protein-coupled receptors and their
	cognate G-proteins strongly influences not only the magnitude of
	the Ca(2+) response but also the process of desensitization and resistance

	We have developed tools for analyzing in vivo multiphoton data sets
	to identify responding structures and events in single cells as well
	as patterns of activity within the neural ensemble. Data were analyzed
	from populations of cerebellar Purkinje cell dendrites, which generate
	calcium-based complex action potentials. For image segmentation,
	active dendrites were identified using a correlation-based method
	to group covarying pixels. Firing events were extracted from dendritic
	fluorescence signals with a 95\% detection rate and an 8\% false-positive
	rate. Because an event that begins in one movie frame is sometimes
	not detected until the next frame, detection delays were compensated
	using a likelihood-based correction procedure. To identify groups
	of dendrites that tended to fire synchronously, a k-means-based procedure
	was developed to analyze pairwise correlations across the population.
	Because repeated runs of k-means often generated dissimilar clusterings,
	the runs were combined to determine a consensus cluster number and
	composition. This procedure, termed meta-k-means, gave clusterings
	as good as individual runs of k-means, was independent of random
	initial seeding, and allowed the exclusion of outliers. Our methods
	should be generally useful for analyzing multicellular activity recordings

	we point out connections to some related standard statistical methods,

	that the computational methods reviewed here do not in fact depend
	on the state-space setting at all; instead, the key property we are
	exploiting involves the bandedness of certain matrices. We close

  abstract = {There are two basic problems in the statistical analysis of neural
	data. The "encoding" problem concerns how information is encoded
	in neural spike trains: can we predict the spike trains of a neuron
	(or population of neurons), given an arbitrary stimulus or observed
	motor response? Conversely, the "decoding" problem concerns how much
	information is in a spike train, in particular, how well can we estimate
	the stimulus that gave rise to the spike train? This chapter describes
	statistical model-based techniques that in some cases provide a unified
	solution to these two coding problems. These models can capture stimulus
	dependencies as well as spike history and interneuronal interaction
	effects in population spike trains, and are intimately related to
	biophysically based models of integrate-and-fire type. We describe
	flexible, powerful likelihood-based methods for fitting these encoding
	models and then for using the models to perform optimal decoding.
	Each of these (apparently quite difficult) tasks turn out to be highly
	computationally tractable, due to a key concavity property of the
	model likelihood. Finally, we return to the encoding problem to describe
	how to use these models to adaptively optimize the stimuli presented
	to the cell on a trial-by-trial basis, in order that we may infer
	the optimal model parameters as efficiently as possible.},

	in the context of the functional boundaries of this sensory map.
	Large- scale confinement of neuronal arbors to single barrels was
	suggested by restricted lateral diffusion of DiI across septa between
	barrels. Morphological analysis of dendritic and axonal arborizations
	of individual excitatory neurons showed that neuronal processes remain
	within the barrel of origin through polarization toward the center
	of the barrel. Functionally, the large-scale properties of the neuronal
	network were investigated through mapping the spatial extent of field
	EPSPs, which were found to attenuate at barrel borders. This ensemble
	property of a layer 4 barrel was further investigated by analyzing
	the connectivity of pairs of excitatory neurons with respect to the
	locations of the somata. Approximately one-third of the excitatory
	neurons within the same barrel were synaptically coupled. At the
	septum between adjacent barrels the connectivity dropped rapidly,
	and very few connections were found between neurons located in adjacent
	barrels. Each layer 4 barrel is thus composed of an excitatory neuronal
	network, which to a first order approximation, acts independently

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The latest clinical trials indicate better performance
	of aromatase inhibitors, compared to tamoxifen, in adjuvant hormonotherapy
	of breast carcinoma. The identification of molecular markers, predicting
	resistance to tamoxifen, could help to identify patients, which are
	most likely to benefit from aromatase inhibitors in up-front adjuvant
	hormonotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Tissue microarrays were constructed
	from archival paraffin blocks of primary tumors of 179 patients with
	estrogen receptor positive operable breast carcinoma in stage I-III,
	subsequently treated with tamoxifen for five years or until relapse,
	with at least 7 years follow up available. The amplifications of
	Her-2 and cyclin D1 genes were evaluated by fluorescence in-situ
	hybridization. The level of progesterone receptor (PR) and Ki67 were
	estimated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: 54 of above patients
	recurred during follow up. In univariate analysis of disease free
	survival, the presence of more than three nodal metastases (RR=4,5
	p<0,001), grade 3 (RR=2,3 p=0,035), cyclin D1 (RR=3,06 p<0,001) and
	Her-2 (RR=3,06 p<0,001) amplifications were identified as significant
	risk factors, together with the negativity of PR (RR=2,1 p=0,013).
	In multivariate analysis, only clinical stage III (RR=2,6 p=0,003),
	cyclin D1 (RR=2,7 p=0,001) and Her-2 (RR=2,1 p=0,014) amplifications
	proved significant. In 77 patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy
	no statistically significant risk factor was identified. In multivariate
	analysis of 102 patients without adjuvant chemotherapy only stage
	III (RR=6,9 p=0,001) and Her-2 amplification (RR=4,5 p=0,001) were
	confirmed. CONCLUSION: The advanced clinical stage, cyclin D1 and
	Her-2 gene amplifications represent factors, predicting the failure
	of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment, but their predictive value is much
	lower in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. This fact indicates,
	they can reflect the common biological aggressiveness of tumor and
	need not to be tamoxifen specific.},

	insights into the structure of the neural code. First, neural encoding

	population level is less noisy than one would expect from the variability

	individual neurons: spike times are more precise, and can be predicted

	the structure and function of biological specimens. Although numerous
	
	commercial laser scanning microscopes exist, some of the more interesting
	
	and challenging applications demand custom design. A major impediment
	
	to custom design is the difficulty of building custom data acquisition
	
	hardware and writing the complex software required to run the laser
	
	scanning microscope. RESULTS: We describe a simple, software-based
	
	approach to operating a laser scanning microscope without the need
	
	for custom data acquisition hardware. Data acquisition and control
	
	of laser scanning are achieved through standard data acquisition
	
	boards. The entire burden of signal integration and image processing
	
	is placed on the CPU of the computer. We quantitate the effectiveness
	
	of our data acquisition and signal conditioning algorithm under a
	
	variety of conditions. We implement our approach in an open source
	
	software package (ScanImage) and describe its functionality. CONCLUSIONS:
	
	We present ScanImage, software to run a flexible laser scanning microscope
	
	that allows easy custom design.},

	signaling and for monitoring activity in populations of neurons.
	
	However, interpreting GECI fluorescence in terms of neural activity
	
	and cytoplasmic-free {Ca}$^{2+}$ concentration ([{Ca}$^{2+}$]) is
	
	complicated by the nonlinear interactions between {Ca}$^{2+}$ binding
	
	and GECI fluorescence. We have characterized GECIs in pyramidal neurons
	
	in cultured hippocampal brain slices, focusing on indicators based
	
	on circularly permuted XFPs [GCaMP (Nakai et al., 2001), Camgaroo2
	
	(Griesbeck et al., 2001), and Inverse Pericam (Nagai et al., 2001)].
	
	Measurements of fluorescence changes evoked by trains of action potentials
	
	revealed that GECIs have little sensitivity at low action potential
	
	frequencies compared with synthetic [{Ca}$^{2+}$] indicators with
	
	similar affinities for {Ca}$^{2+}$. The sensitivity of GECIs improved
	
	for high-frequency trains of action potentials, indicating that GECIs
	
	are supralinear indicators of neural activity. Simultaneous measurement
	
	of GECI fluorescence and [{Ca}$^{2+}$] revealed supralinear relationships.
	
	We compared GECI fluorescence saturation with CaM {Ca}$^{2+}$-dependent
	
	structural transitions. Our data suggest that GCaMP and Camgaroo2
	
	report CaM structural transitions in the presence and absence of

	cells modify the responses of principal cells, but they do not receive

	respond well to tonal stimuli in the awake mouse and they have a
	
	well-defined characteristic frequency that corresponds to the tonotopic
	
	organization of the DCN. The auditory responses of cartwheel cells
	
	exhibit complex spectrotemporal responses to tones, with excitation
	
	and inhibition modulating the firing patterns in both frequency and
	
	time after onset of the stimulus. Temporal responses to best-frequency
	
	tones are highly variable between cartwheel cells, but a simple model
	
	is used to unify this variability as differences in the timing of

	electroosmotic flow through a submicrometer channel with an electric
	charge fixed on the channel walls is presented. This system is governed

	The model is based on the coupled mass balances, Poisson, Navier-Stokes,
	and Nernst-Planck equations. Nonslip boundary conditions are employed.
	The effect of an imposed electric field on the system behavior is
	studied by means of a numerical analysis of the model equations.
	We have obtained the following findings. If the channel width is
	comparable to the thickness of the electric double layer, the system
	behaves as an ion-exchange membrane and the dependence of the electric
	current passing through the channel on the applied voltage is strongly
	nonlinear. In the case of negatively (positively) charged walls,
	a narrow region of very low conductivity (so-called ionic gate) is
	formed in the free electrolyte near the channel entry facing the
	anode (cathode) side. For a wide channel, the electric current is
	proportional to the applied voltage and the velocity of electrokinetic
	flow is linearly proportional to the electric field strength. Complex
	hydrodynamics (eddy formation and existence of ionic gates) is the
	most interesting characteristics of the studied system. Hence, current-voltage
	and velocity-voltage curves and the corresponding spatial distributions
	of the model variables at selected points are studied and described

  abstract = {We examined the effect of unilateral restricted cochlear lesions in
	
	adult cats on the topographic representations ("maps") of the lesioned
	
	and unlesioned cochleas in the primary auditory cortex (AI) contralateral
	
	to the lesioned cochlea. Frequency (tonotopic) maps were derived
	
	by conventional multineuron mapping procedures in anesthetized animals.
	
	In confirmation of a study in adult guinea pigs (Robertson and Irvine
	
	[1989] J. Comp. Neurol. 282:456-471), we found that 2-11 months after
	
	the unilateral cochlear lesion the map of the lesioned cochlea in
	
	the contralateral AI was altered so that the AI region in which frequencies
	
	with lesion-induced elevations in cochlear neural sensitivity would
	
	have been represented was occupied by an enlarged representation
	
	of lesion-edge frequencies (i.e., frequencies adjacent to those with
	
	elevated cochlear neural sensitivity). Along the tonotopic axis of
	
	AI the total representation of lesion-edge frequencies could extend
	
	up to approximately 2.6 mm rostal to the area of normal representation
	
	of these frequencies. There was no topographic order within this
	
	enlarged representation. Examination of threshold sensitivity at
	
	the characteristic frequency (CF, frequency to which the neurons
	
	were most sensitive) in the reorganized regions of the map of the
	
	lesioned cochlea established that the changes in the map reflected
	
	a plastic reorganization rather than simply reflecting the residue
	
	of prelesion input. In contrast to the change in the map of the lesioned
	
	contralateral cochlea, the map of the unlesioned ipsilateral cochlea
	
	did not differ from those in normal animals. Thus, in contrast to
	
	the normal very good congruency between ipsilateral and contralateral
	
	AI maps, in the lesioned animals ipsilateral and contralateral maps
	
	differed in the region of AI in which there had been a reorganization
	
	of the map of the lesioned cochlea. Outside the region of contralateral
	
	map reorganization, ipsilateral and contralateral AI maps remained
	
	congruent within normal limits. The difference between the two maps
	
	in the region of contralateral map reorganization suggested, in light
	
	of the physiology of binaural interactions in the auditory pathway,
	
	that the cortical reorganization reflected subcortical changes. Finally,
	
	response properties of neuronal clusters within the reorganized map
	
	of the lesioned cochlea were compared to normative data with respect
	
	to threshold sensitivity at CF, the size of frequency "response areas,"
	
	and response latencies. In the majority of cases, CF thresholds were
	
	similar to normative data. The frequency "response areas" were slightly
	
	less sharply tuned than normal, but not significantly. Response latencies
	
	were significantly shorter than normal in three animals and significantly
	
	longer in one animal.},

	a second neuronal circuit in the deaf white cat involving modified

	loss of extracellular space between ending and cell body. The somata

	fibers, and their associated boutons, were labeled with several calcium
	
	indicators. When parallel fibers were extracellularly activated with
	
	stimulus trains, calcium accumulated in the terminals, producing
	
	changes in the fluorescence of the indicators. During the stimulus
	
	train, the fluorescence change per pulse became progressively smaller

	enhancement. We have simultaneously measured presynaptic residual
	
	free calcium ([Ca2+]i) and postsynaptic field potentials at this
	
	synapse to examine the role of [Ca2+]i in this enhancement. Single
	
	action potentials produced an increase in [Ca2+]i of 10-50 nM that
	
	decayed to resting levels with a time constant of about 1 sec. Trains
	
	of action potentials produced larger [Ca2+]i increases that returned
	
	more slowly to resting levels. Following the onset of moderate frequency
	
	stimulus trains (0.1-5 Hz), synaptic transmission and [Ca2+]i both
	
	increased and eventually plateaued. During the steady-state phase
	
	a linear relationship between [Ca2+]i and synaptic enhancement was

	rapidly than synaptic enhancement. Similarly, during the decay phase

	An increase in [Ca2+]i of 10-30 nM produced a twofold enhancement.

	assumes that synaptic enhancement is controlled by a Ca-dependent
	
	first-order reaction. According to this scheme, a change in [Ca2+]i

	Three genetic loci in chickens determine the susceptibility or resistance

	of chickens display phenotypes that are somewhere in between either
	efficiently susceptible or resistant to infection by specific subgroups
	of ASLV. The tvb gene encodes the receptor for subgroups B, D, and

	accounts for the altered susceptibility of an inbred chicken line,

	The tvb gene in line M, tvb(r2), encodes a mutant Tvb(S1) receptor

	125 (C125S). Here, we show that the C125S substitution in Tvb(S1)

	substitution significantly reduces the binding affinity of the Tvb(S1)
	receptor for the subgroup B, D, and E ASLV envelope glycoproteins.
	These are the first results that demonstrate a possible role of the

  abstract = {Single-unit recording studies in th macaque have carefully documented
	the modulatory effects of attention on the response properties of
	visual cortical neurons. Attention produces qualitatively different
	effects on firing rate, depending on whether a stimulus appears alone
	or accompanied by distracters. Studies of contrast gain control in
	anesthetized mammals have found parallel patterns of results when
	the luminance contrast of a stimulus increases. This finding suggests
	that attention has coopted the circuits that mediate contrast gain
	control and that it operates by increasing the effective contrast
	of the attended stimulus. Consistent with this idea, microstimulation
	of the frontal eye fields, one of several areas that control the
	allocation of spatial attention, induces spatially local increases
	in sensitivity both at the behavioral level and amont neurons in
	area V4, where endogenously generated attention increases contrast
	sensitivity. Studies in the slice have begun to explain how modulatory
	signals might cause such increases in sensitivity.},

	When multiple stimuli appear within a neuronï¾’s receptive field

	suggests that cortical cells may be ï¾“hard wiredï¾” to respond preferentially
	to the highest-contrast stimulus in their RF, and neural systems
	for attention capitalize on this mechanism by dynamically increasing
	the effective contrast of the stimulus that is task relevant. To
	test this, we varied the relative contrast of two stimuli within
	the recorded neuronsï¾’ RFs, while the monkeys attended away to another
	location. In- creasing the physical contrast of one stimulus caused
	V4 neurons to respond preferentially to that stimulus and reduced
	their responses to competing stimuli. When attention was directed
	to the lower-contrast stimulus, it partially overcame the influence
	of a competing, higher-contrast stimulus.},

	the latter of which is tightly correlated with calcium activity in
	
	ORN axons, supporting the idea of glomerular propagation of olfactory
	
	information. Finally, we showed that odors are represented by a sparse

  abstract = {Extraction of structures of interest in medical images is often an
	arduous task because of noisy or incomplete data. However, handsegmented
	data are often available and most of the structures to be extracted
	have a similar shape from one subject to an other. Then, the possibility
	of modeling a family of shapes and restricting the new structure
	to be extracted within this class is of particular interest. This
	approach is commonly implemented using active shape models [2] and
	the definition of the image term is the most challenging component
	of such an approach. In parallel, level set methods [8] define a
	powerful optimization framework, that can be used to recover objects
	of interest by the propagation of curves or surfaces. They can support
	complex topologies, considered in higher dimensions, are implicit,
	intrinsic and parameter free. In this paper we re-visit active shape
	models and introduce a level set variant of them. Such an approach
	can account for prior shape knowledge quite efficiently as well as
	use data/image terms of various form and complexity. Promising results
	on the extraction of brain ventricles in MR images demonstrate the
	potential of our approach.},

	ranged from 31-321 microns and was inversely related to fiber CF

	the control of transmitter release. However, most presynaptic boutons
	
	in the vertebrate central nervous system are too small to allow electrical
	
	recordings of presynaptic calcium currents (I(Ca)pre). We therefore
	
	tested the possibility of measuring I(Ca)pre optically in boutons
	
	loaded with calcium-sensitive fluorophores. From a theoretical treatment
	
	of a system containing an endogenous buffer and an indicator, we

	We developed methods that reliably detect single action potentials

	This activity-dependent depression of {Ca}$^{2+}$ extrusion is, in

	{Ca}$^{2+}$ extrusion recovers from depression with a time constant
	
	of 0.5 s. Depression of {Ca}$^{2+}$ extrusion provides a positive

	extrusion produces {Ca}$^{2+}$ concentration dynamics that depend

	Golgi impregnated non-pyramidal neurons were gold-toned and deimpregnated,
	allowing an electron microscopic analysis of the identified structures.
	With regard to cell body location and dendritic pattern, non-pyramidal
	cells are a rather heterogeneous group of neurons. Their perikarya
	were found in all hippocampal layers and their dendrites had a less
	regular orientation when compared to pyramidal neurons and granule
	cells. Two basic types, i.e., "vertical" and "horizontal" non-pyramidal
	neurons are described. Many cells were of an intermediate type with
	dendrites extending in all directions. Non-pyramidal cell dendrites
	were mostly devoid of spines but exhibited numerous varicosities.
	Non-pyramidal cell axons could sometimes be seen extending towards
	the pyramidal cell layer. A surprising uniformity was observed when
	the impregnated, identified non-pyramidal neurons were studied in
	the electron microscope. Their perikarya exhibited a well-developed
	endoplasmic reticulum and indented nuclei. Both the cell bodies and
	the varicose dendrites were densely covered with synaptic boutons
	which mainly formed asymmetric synaptic contacts. Only occasionally
	were symmetric synaptic contacts observed. Non-pyramidal cell dendrites
	extending into the stratum lucidum of CA3 were found to be contacted
	by the giant boutons of mossy fiber axons. In addition to synaptic
	contacts, the dendrites of gold-toned non-pyramidal neurons formed

	for the investigation of neuronal function. Neuronal shape is important
	for the wiring of networks, and dendritic architecture strongly affects
	neuronal integration and firing properties as demonstrated by modeling
	approaches. Confocal microscopy allows to scan neurons with submicron
	resolution. However, it is still a tedious task to reconstruct complex
	dendritic trees with fine structures just above voxel resolution.
	We present a framework assisting the reconstruction. User time investment
	is strongly reduced by automatic methods, which fit a skeleton and
	a surface to the data, while the user can interact and thus keeps
	full control to ensure a high quality reconstruction. The reconstruction
	process composes a successive gain of metric parameters. First, a
	structural description of the neuron is built, including the topology
	and the exact dendritic lengths and diameters. We use generalized
	cylinders with circular cross sections. The user provides a rough
	initialization by marking the branching points. The axes and radii
	are fitted to the data by minimizing an energy functional, which
	is regularized by a smoothness constraint. The investigation of proximity
	to other structures throughout dendritic trees requires a precise
	surface reconstruction. In order to achieve accuracy of 0.1 microm
	and below, we additionally implemented a segmentation algorithm based
	on geodesic active contours that allow for arbitrary cross sections
	and uses locally adapted thresholds. In summary, this new reconstruction
	tool saves time and increases quality as compared to other methods,

  number = {7},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Histone-modifying enzymes are essential for a wide variety
	of cellular processes dependent upon changes in gene expression.
	Histone deacetylases (HDACs) lead to the compaction of chromatin
	and subsequent silencing of gene transcription, and they have recently
	been implicated in a diversity of functions and dysfunctions in the
	postnatal and adult brain including ocular dominance plasticity,
	memory consolidation, drug addiction, and depression. Here we investigate
	the role of HDACs in the generation of neurons and astrocytes in
	the embryonic brain. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: As a variety of HDACs are
	expressed in differentiating neural progenitor cells, we have taken
	a pharmacological approach to inhibit multiple family members. Inhibition
	of class I and II HDACs in developing mouse embryos with trichostatin
	A resulted in a dramatic reduction in neurogenesis in the ganglionic
	eminences and a modest increase in neurogenesis in the cortex. An
	identical effect was observed upon pharmacological inhibition of
	HDACs in in vitro-differentiating neural precursors derived from
	the same brain regions. A reduction in neurogenesis in ganglionic
	eminence-derived neural precursors was accompanied by an increase
	in the production of immature astrocytes. We show that HDACs control
	neurogenesis by inhibition of the bone morphogenetic protein BMP2/4
	signaling pathway in radial glial cells. HDACs function at the transcriptional
	level by inhibiting and promoting, respectively, the expression of
	Bmp2 and Smad7, an intracellular inhibitor of BMP signaling. Inhibition
	of the BMP2/4 signaling pathway restored normal levels of neurogenesis
	and astrogliogenesis to both ganglionic eminence- and cortex-derived
	cultures in which HDACs were inhibited. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
	demonstrate a transcriptionally-based regulation of BMP2/4 signaling
	by HDACs both in vivo and in vitro that is critical for neurogenesis
	in the ganglionic eminences and that modulates cortical neurogenesis.
	The results also suggest that HDACs may regulate the developmental
	switch from neurogenesis to astrogliogenesis that occurs in late
	gestation.},

	In hippocampal slices, serial electron microscopy was used to examine
	a nearly homogeneous population of CA3-->CA1 axons in the middle
	of stratum radiatum of area CA1. The locations of postsynaptic densities
	(PSDs), vesicles, and mitochondria were determined along 75 axon
	segments (9.1 +/- 2.0 micrometer in length). Synapses, defined by
	the colocalization of PSDs and vesicles, occurred on average at 2.7
	micrometer intervals along the axons. Most varicosities (68%) had
	one PSD, 19% had 2-4 PSDs, and 13% had none. Synaptic vesicles occurred
	in 90% of the varicosities. One-half (53%) of the varicosities lacked
	mitochondria, raising questions about their regulation of ATP and
	Ca2+, and 8% of varicosities contained only mitochondria. Eleven
	axons were reconstructed fully. The varicosities were oblong and
	varied greatly in both length (1.1 +/- 0.7 micrometer) and volume

	were narrow, tubular, and similar in diameter (0.17 +/- 0.04 micrometer)

	shafts resemble dendritic spine necks and thus could promote biochemical
	compartmentalization of individual axonal varicosities. The findings
	raise the intriguing possibility of localized differences in metabolism

	We have shown that human pancreatic cancer cells respond to collagen
	by up-regulating N-cadherin, which promotes tumor growth, invasion,
	and metastasis. Initial characterization showed that knocking down
	c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase prevented N-cadherin up-regulation and
	limited tumor growth and invasion in a mouse model for pancreatic
	cancer. The current study was designed to understand the pathway
	from collagen to N-cadherin up-regulation. Initiation of the signal
	requires two collagen receptors, alpha2beta1 integrin and discoidin
	domain receptor (DDR) 1. Each receptor propagates signals through
	separate pathways that converge to up-regulate N-cadherin. Focal
	adhesion kinase (FAK)-related protein tyrosine kinase (Pyk2) is downstream
	of DDR1, whereas FAK is downstream of alpha2beta1 integrin. Both
	receptor complexes rely on the p130 Crk-associated substrate scaffold.

  abstract = {This paper describes a framework for learning probabilistic models
	of objects and scenes and for exploiting these models for tracking
	complex, deformable, or articulated objects in image sequences. We
	focus on the probabilistic tracking of people and learn models of
	how they appear and move in images. In particular, we learn the likelihood
	of observing various spatial and temporal filter responses corresponding
	to edges, ridges, and motion differences given a model of the person.
	Similarly, we learn probability distributions over filter responses
	for general scenes that define a likelihood of observing the filter
	responses for arbitrary backgrounds. We then derive a probabilistic
	model for tracking that exploits the ratio between the likelihood
	that image pixels corresponding to the foreground (person) were generated
	by an actual person or by some unknown background. The paper extends
	previous work on learning image statistics and combines it with Bayesian
	tracking using particle filtering. By combining multiple image cues,
	and by using learned likelihood models, we demonstrate improved robustness
	and accuracy when tracking complex objects such as people in monocular
	image sequences with cluttered scenes and a moving camera.},

  title = {Edge measures using similarity regions},

  note = {The paper deals with edge detection as interface between homogeneous
	regions. It is related to hierarchical clustering and multiscale
	clustering/smoothing in a way. No doubt applicable to segmentation
	of different grayscale level/color regions, but uncertain in applicability
	for narrow dark edges detection.},
  abstract = {In this paper, we present a new approach to edge detection. We see
	edges as delineators of local, photometrically coherent clusters
	of pixels. We are concerned with edges at a given pair of photometric
	and spatial scales. We first define the Similarity Region (SR) of
	a pixel as the set of pixels in it's neighborhood that form a local
	cluster with the pixel. The SR is discovered by using an affinity
	measure at the given spatial and photometric scales. It follows then
	that the SR's for two adjacent pixels within a region will be similar
	and they will be different for pixels across a region boundary. This
	property is used to determine if there is an edge between any two
	pixels. SR's of a pixel pair are evaluated for similarity in two
	ways - by comparing their geometric properties and by comparing the
	affinity distributions of pixels within them. This leads to two edge
	operators. The first uses Normalized difference of Moments (NdM)
	of the two SR's, while the second uses a \chi^2-measure of the two
	affinity distributions. These edge operators are fast, they respond
	to local edge freatures like corners faithfully and they do not introduce
	bias or localization errors for images with ESNR (Edge Strength to
	Noise Ratio) greater than 10dB. For higher noise, the methods respond
	to edges of regions formed by noise. For robustness, we propose a
	preprocessing step that clusters data. To this end, we present two
	clustering algorithms based on cost function optimization. The first
	algorithm is an Iterated Mode algorithm that uses the histogram of
	pixel values in a local window to replace each pixel value with a
	value that has higher probability of occurrence at that pixel. The
	second algoruthm minimizes a Soft Clustering Evaluation Function
	(SCEF) to partition the image into clusters such that the mutual
	information between these clusters is minimized. This work is closely
	related to Rosenfeld et al.'s iterative smoothing algoruthms, histogram-based
	techniques and pyramid linking shcmes; these relationships are pointed
	out. We present the responses of edge operators on synthetic and
	real images. The integration of these operators to define coherent
	edge detectors will be reported in the near future.},

	indicates that the ES-specific miR-290 cluster has an important regulatory
	function in undifferentiated ES cells. Consistently, many of the

	by accumulation of repressive histone marks but not by DNA methylation,
	which prevents the stable repression of Oct4. The methylation defect
	correlates with downregulation of de novo DNA methyltransferases
	(Dnmts). The downregulation is mediated by Rbl2 and possibly other
	transcriptional repressors, potential direct targets of miR-290 cluster
	miRNAs. The defective DNA methylation can be rescued by ectopic expression
	of de novo Dnmts or by transfection of the miR-290 cluster miRNAs,

	size was computed by three-dimensional reconstruction from serial
	electron microscopy (EM). Serial EM also was used to compute synapse

	stubby, or branched dendritic spines and macular, perforated, or
	segmented postsynaptic densities), on the frequency of shaft synapses,

	suggest that LTP does not cause an overall formation of new synapses
	nor an enlargement of synapses at 2 hr post-tetanus in hippocampal
	area CA1, and these results support the hypothesis that LTP could
	involve a redistribution of synaptic weights among existing synapses.},

  abstract = {Recent physiological work has used quantal analysis to investigate
	the properties of synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation
	in hippocampal area CA1. These analyses have revealed changes in
	the strength of excitatory post-synaptic responses following long-term
	potentiation that could be mediated by cellular mechanisms in the
	presynaptic element, in the postsynaptic element, or in both elements.
	In these studies, either minimal stimulation, presumably involving
	a single presynaptic axon, or recordings from pairs of CA3 and CA1
	cells have been used. Interpretation of these quantal analyses requires
	knowledge about whether single or multiple synapses occur between
	the presynaptic axon and its target CA1 pyramidal cells. Here, light
	and serial electron microscopy was used to begin to examine this
	question and a related question concerning the ultrastructure of
	spines on multiple-synapse boutons. Light microscopic analyses of
	Golgi preparations revealed that about 20% of the axons occurring
	in stratum radiatum come into close apposition with two to four different
	dendrites of a target CA1 cell. An "apposition" was defined as a
	point where the axons and dendrites crossed in the same focal plane
	and therefore were sufficiently close to allow a dendritic spine
	to reach the axon and possibly establish a synaptic contact. An additional
	4% of the axons wound back and forth across individual dendrites,
	possibly forming multiple synapses closely spaced along the dendrites.
	Serial electron microscopy revealed that 24% of the individual axonal
	boutons in stratum radiatum make synapses with multiple dendritic
	spines arising from either the same or different dendritic segments.
	Two adjacent boutons of the same axon could also be found to synapse
	with different spines of the same dendrite. Together with the light
	microscopic analysis, these observations suggest that multiple synapses
	occur between single axons in stratum radiatum and their target CA1
	cells, and that at least some of these synapses may occur at different
	electronic distances. If these multiple synapses have different physiological
	strengths, then they may obscure or smooth peaks in the frequency
	histograms that are used for quantal analyses. A three-dimensional
	analysis was done to compare the dimensions of pairs of dendritic
	spines synapsing with individual axonal boutons. When the pairs of
	spines associated with a single bouton arose from different dendrites,
	at least some of which were likely to have come from different cells,
	the differences between their volumes and the areas of the postsynaptic
	densities were on average 100% and ranged up to 650%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

  abstract = {Locations of a distinctive mode of trans-endocytosis involving dendrites,
	axons, and glia were quantified through serial section electron microscopy.
	Short vesicular or long vermiform evaginations emerged from dendrites
	and axons and were engulfed by presynaptic or neighboring axons,
	astrocytes, and, surprisingly, a growth cone to form double-membrane
	structures called spinules. In total, 254 spinules were evaluated
	in 326 micron^3 of stratum radiatum in area CA1 of mature rat hippocampus.
	Spinules emerged from spine heads (62%), necks (24%), axons (13%),
	dendritic shafts (1%), or nonsynaptic protrusions (<1%) and invaginated
	into axons (<90%), astrocytic processes (<8%), or a growth cone (<1%).
	Coated pits occurred on the engulfing membrane at the tips of most
	spinules ( 69%), and double-membrane structures occurred freely in
	axonal and astrocytic cytoplasm, suggesting trans-endocytosis. Spinule
	locations differed among mushroom and thin spines. For mushroom spines,
	most (84%) of the spinules were engulfed by presynaptic axons, 16%
	by neighboring axons, and none by astrocytic processes. At thin spines,
	only 17% of the spinules were engulfed by presynaptic axons, whereas
	67% were engulfed by neighboring axons and 14% by astrocytic processes.
	Spinules engulfed by astrocytic processes support the growing evidence
	that perisynaptic glia interact directly with synapses at least on
	thin spines. Spinules with neighboring axons may provide a mechanism
	for synaptic competition in the mature brain. Trans-endocytosis of
	spinules by presynaptic axons suggest retrograde signaling or coordinated
	remodeling of presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes to remove transient
	perforations and assemble the postsynaptic density of large synapses
	on mushroom spines.},

  pages = {9911022},
  abstract = {We outline a different method of describing scalar field particle
	production in a uniform electric field. In the standard approach,
	the (analytically continued) harmonic oscillator paradigm is important
	in describing particle production. In the gauges normally considered,
	in which the four vector potential depends only on the time or space
	coordinate, the system reduces to a non-relativistic effective SchrÂ¨odinger
	equation with an inverted oscillator potential. The Bogolubov coefficients
	are determined by tunnelling in this potential. In the Schwinger
	proper time method of determining the effective Lagrangian, the analytically
	continued propagator for the usual oscillator system is regarded
	as the correct propagator for the inverted oscillator system and
	is used to obtain the gauge invariant result. However, there is another
	gauge in which the particle production process has striking similarities
	with the one used to describe Hawking radiation in black holes. The
	gauge we use to describe the electric field in is the lightcone gauge,
	so named because the mode functions for a scalar field are found
	to be singular on the lightcone. We use these modes in evaluating
	the effective Lagrangian using the proper time technique. The key
	feature of this analysis is that these modes can be explicitly ï¾“normalizedï¾”
	by using the criterion that they reduce to the usual flat space modes
	in the limit of the electric field tending to zero. This normalization
	procedure allows one to determine the Schwinger proper time kernel
	without using the analytical continuation of the harmonic oscillator
	kernel that is resorted to in the standard analysis. We find that
	the proper time kernel is not the same as the analytically continued
	oscillator kernel though the effective Lagrangian is the standard
	result as it should be. We also consider an example of a confined
	electric field system using the lightcone gauge modes that has several
	features of interest. In particular, our analysis indicates that
	the Bogolubov coefficients, in taking the limit to the uniform electric
	field case, are multiplied by energy dependent boundary factors that
	have not been taken into account before.},

  abstract = {The light-front (LF) quantization of QCD in light-cone gauge has a
	number of remarkable advantages, including explicit unitarity, a
	physical Fock expansion, the absence of ghost degrees of freedom,
	and the decoupling properties needed to prove factorization theorems
	in high momentum transfer inclusive and exclusive reactions. We present
	a systematic study of LF-quantized gauge theory following the Dirac
	method and construct the Dyson-Wick S-matrix expansion based on LF-time-ordered
	products. The free theory gauge field is shown to satisfy the Lorentz
	condition as an operator equation as well as the light-cone gauge
	condition. Its propagator is found to be transverse with respect
	to both its four-momentum and the gauge direction. The interaction
	Hamiltonian of QCD can be expressed in a form resembling that of
	covariant theory, except for additional instantaneous interactions
	which can be treated systematically. The renormalization constants
	in YM theory are shown to satisfy the identity Z1 = Z3 at one loop
	order. The QCD function computed in the noncovariant light-cone gauge
	agrees with that known in the conventional framework. Some comments
	on the relationship of our LF framework, with the doubly transverse
	gauge propagator, to the analytic effective charge and renormalization
	scheme defined by the pinch technique, the unitarity relations and
	the spectral representation are also made. LF quantization thus provides
	a consistent formulation of gauge theory, despite the fact that the
	hyperplanes x^pm = 0 used to impose boundary conditions constitute
	characteristic surfaces of a hyperbolic partial di erential equation.},

	In a formal representation for teh Schwinger functional, we treat
	the off-diagonal terms of the Gaussian factor as a perturbation abotu
	the remaining terms of the functional integral. In this way, we develop
	a perturbative expansion around the ultra-local model, where fields
	defined at different points of Euclidean space are decoupled. We
	first study the strong-coupling expansion in the lambda phi^4_d theory
	and also quantum electrodynamics. Assuming the ultra-local approximation,
	we examine the singularities of these perturbative expansions, analysing
	the analytic structrure of the zero-dimensional generating functions
	in the complex coupling constant plane. Second, we discuss the ultra-local
	generating functional in two idealized field theory models defined
	by the following interaction Lagrangians: L_II(g_1,g_2;phi)=g_1 phi^p(x)+g_2
	phi^-p(x), and the sinh-Gordon model, i.e. L_III(g_3,g_4;phi)=g_3(cosh(g_4
	phi(x))-1). To control the divergences of the strong-coupling perturbative
	expansion two different steps are used throughout the paper. First,
	we introduce a lattice structure to give meaning to the ultra-local
	generating functional. Using an analytic regularization procedure
	we discuss briefly how it is possible to obtain a renormalized Schwinger
	functional associated with these scalar models, going beyond the
	ultra-local approximation without using a lattice regularization
	procedure. Using the strong-coupling perturbative expansion we shod
	how it is possible to compute the renormalized vacuum energy of a

  abstract = {In her initial research, Elizabeth D. Hay studied amphibian limb regeneration,
	but later switched her focus, and for the remainder of her career
	addressed the role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in regulating
	embryonic morphogenesis. Much of that work used the embryonic chick
	corneal epithelial model. This review highlights many of the discoveries
	that she made using this model. Hay was the first to show that embryonic
	corneal epithelial cells produce fibrillar collagen. Her lab was
	among the first to demonstrate that corneal epithelial cells respond
	to a collagenous substrate by increasing ECM production, and that
	purified ECM molecules, added to cultures of epithelial sheets, induce
	a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. These data led to the
	first theories of cell-matrix interactions, illustrated in a 'hands
	across the membrane' sketch drawn by Hay. Recent work with the epithelial
	sheet model system has elucidated many of the signal transduction
	pathways required for actin reorganization in response to the ECM.
	In all, this body of work has amply supported Hay's belief that the
	embryonic corneal epithelium is a powerful model system for exploring
	the role of the ECM in regulating the cytoskeleton, in directing
	cell migration, and in profoundly influencing cell growth and differentiation
	during development.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed
	against the HER-2 receptor. Trastuzumab-based therapy significantly
	improves response rate (RR), time to progression (TTP) and overall
	survival (OS) for women with HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer.
	Despite its initial efficacy, acquired resistance to trastuzumab
	develops in a majority of patients with MBC, and a large subset never
	responds, demonstrating primary resistance. The purpose of this retrospective
	study was to determine prognostic factors applicable to clinical
	practice. METHODS: We enrolled 112 women with metastatic breast cancer,
	who started the trastuzumab-based therapy at Masaryk Memorial Cancer
	Institute until January 2007. Clinical and laboratory factors, such
	as: patients conditions, character ofmetastatic spread, histology,
	estrogen, progesterone and Her-2 receptor status, Her-2/neu gene
	amplification, and serum tumor markers CEA, CA 15-3 and extracellular
	domain of Her-2 receptor (S-HER-2 ECD) were monitored. The association
	of all factors to response to therapy, time to progression (TTP)
	and overall survival (OS) was assessed. RESULTS: In 95\% patients,
	the trastuzumab was combined with cytostatics (83\% taxanes), 88,4\%
	of patients started the trastuzumab as the first or second-line anticancer
	treatment. The median TTP was 284 days (9,3 months) and the median
	OS was 612 days (20,1 months) for all patients, RR was 54,5\%. The
	highest RR was associated with the first-line treatment (p<0.0001)
	and with HER-2 gene/Chromosome 17 ratio > 2,2 (p=0,0092). Eleven
	patients (9,8\%) discontinued the treatment because of toxicity,
	7 patients did it as a result of cardiotoxicity (6,2\%). CNS metastases
	occurred in 31 patients (27,7\%). The S-HER-2 ECD was the most frequently
	elevated serum marker at the time of the treatment initialization
	(72,5\%) and at the time of the progression (55,9\%). Cox regression
	analysis identified S-HER-2 ECD levels at the beginning and between
	day 90 and 130 of the trastuzumab therapy as the best predictors
	of TTP. On the other hand the best predictor of OS was level of CEA
	before the treatment started and level of S-HER-2 ECD between day
	90 and 130 of the trastuzumab therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed
	that the only one predictive marker for response to trastuzumab therapy
	is a proof of HER-2 tumor positivity.The highest prevalence of S-HER-2
	ECD positivity among serum tumor markers and the strong association
	between initial and subsequent S-HER-2 ECD serum concentrations and
	time to progression and overall survival make the S-HER-2 ECD the
	most significant prognostic marker.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Estrogen exposure is a risk factor for gallstone disease
	(cholelithiasis), which often leads to chronic inflammation (cholecystitis).
	Studies in various estrogen-sensitive tissues showed that key enzymes
	involved in the inactivation and activation of estrogens as well
	as expression of estrogen receptors alpha and beta determine the
	amount of active estrogen. In estrogen-sensitive tissues, e.g. the
	female breast, estrone sulfate (E1S), present at high concentrations
	in the circulation, is converted into the biologically active estrone
	(E1) by steroid sulfatase (STS) and again reverted into E1S by estrogen
	sulfotransferase (SULT1E1) providing a local estrogen storage. AIMS:
	To assess whether this might also apply for gallbladder epithelia,
	we determined expression of these two enzymes and of ERalpha and
	ERbeta in 15 cholelithiasis specimens from tissues with/or without
	inflammation. METHODS: Quantitative (Real-time) PCR and immunofluorescence
	were used as methods. RESULTS: We demonstrate mRNA expression of
	SULT1E1, STS, and ERalpha in all specimens with mean enrichment of
	3.53- vs. 1.72-fold (n.s.), 3.5- vs. 0.91-fold (n.s.), and 3.04-
	vs. 1.6-fold (n.s.) in the inflammatory and non-inflammatory groups,
	respectively. Although high expression levels were seen in many specimens
	(means 4.88-fold vs. 5.77-fold), ERbeta mRNA was below the detection
	limit in two specimens from cholecystitis patients. To further investigate
	this varying expression pattern of ERbeta, immunohistological studies
	were performed, which indeed showed low expression levels of ERbeta
	in the damaged mucosa, while in specimens with well preserved mucosa,
	high ERbeta levels were seen in the cytosol and in the nucleus. CONCLUSION:
	The data show expression of an estrogen network of activating STS
	and inactivating SULT1E1. Together with ERalpha and ERbeta, these
	enzymes could regulate estrogen concentrations in human gallbladder.},

	was a significant correlation (r=0.47) found between the levels of
	8-OH-dG and neopterin (as normalized to urinary creatinine levels).
	These findings strongly indicate that the higher level of immune
	response that was correlating with old age contributes significantly
	to the higher level of oxidative damage as assessed in the form of
	8-OH-dG. Using this type of HPLC system, it is possible to evaluate
	oxidative DNA damage and immune response simultaneously using the
	respective urinary markers. These data may contribute to understanding

	for quantum mechanical systems. Relevant aspects of the Hamiltonian
	path integral and its measure are discussed and used to show that
	the quantum mechanical version of the classical transformation does
	not leave the measure of the path integral invariant, instead inducing
	an anomaly. The relation to operator techniques and ordering problems
	is discussed, and special attention is paid to incorporation of the
	initial and nal states of the transition element into the boundary
	conditions of the problem. Classical canonical transformations are
	developed to render an arbitrary power potential cyclic. The resulting
	Hamiltonian is analyzed as a quantum system to show its relation
	to known quantum mechanical results. A perturbative argument is used
	to suppress ordering related terms in the transformed Hamiltonian
	in the event that the classical canonical transformation leads to
	a nonquadratic cyclic Hamiltonian. The associated anomalies are analyzed
	to yield general methods to evaluate the path integral's prefactor
	for such systems. The methods are applied to several systems, including
	linear and quadratic potentials, the velocity-dependent potential,

	The former challenge may arise because most sensors employ calmodulin
	(CaM) as the Ca(2+)-sensing module, such that interference via endogenous
	CaM may result. One class of sensors that could minimize this concern
	utilizes troponin C as the Ca(2+) sensor. Here, we therefore probed
	the reliability and kinetics of one representative of this class
	(CFP/YFP-FRET sensor TN-L15) within cardiac ventricular myocytes.
	These cells furnished a pertinent live-cell test environment, given
	substantial endogenous CaM levels and fast reproducible Ca(2+) transients
	for testing sensor kinetics. TN-L15 was virally expressed within
	myocytes, and Indo-1 acutely loaded to monitor 'true' Ca(2+) transients.
	This configuration permitted independent and simultaneous detection
	of TN-L15 and Indo 1 signals within individual cells. The relation
	between TN-L15 FRET responses and Indo-1 Ca(2+) transients appeared
	reproducible, though FRET signals were delayed compared to Ca(2+)
	transients. Nonetheless, a three state mechanism sufficed to map
	between measured Ca(2+) transients and actual TN-L15 outputs. Overall,
	reproducibility of TN-L15 dynamics, coupled with algorithmic transforms
	between FRET and Ca(2+) signals, renders these sensors promising

	Ultimately, one would like to link the developmental biology to various
	aspects of behavior. We are studying the consequences of nicotine
	exposure on nervous system development in zebrafish and have previously
	shown that chronic nicotine exposure produces paralysis. We also
	have made observations that the embryos moved in the initial minutes
	of the exposure as the bend rates of the musculature increased. This
	nicotine induced behavior manifests as an increase in the rate of
	spinal musculature bends, which spontaneously begin at approximately
	17 h post fertilization. The behavioral observations prompted the
	systematic characterization of nicotine-induced modulation of zebrafish
	embryonic motor output; bends of the trunk musculature. We first
	characterized embryonic motor output in zebrafish embryos with and
	without their chorions. We then characterized the motor output in
	embryos raised at 28 degrees C and 25 degrees C. The act of dechorionation
	along with temperature influenced the embryonic bend rate. We show
	that nicotine exposure increases embryonic motor output. Nicotine
	exposure caused the musculature bends to alternate in a left-right-left
	fashion. Nicotine was able to produce this phenotype in embryos lacking
	supraspinal input. We then characterize the kinetics of nicotine
	influx and efflux and demonstrate that nicotine as low as 1 muM can
	disrupt embryonic physiology. Taken together, these results indicate
	the presence of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) associated
	with embryonic spinal motor circuits early in embryogenesis.},

  journal = {Journal of physiology},
  year = {2005},
  abstract = {Recordings from area V4 of monkeys have revealed that when the focus
	of attention is on a visual stimulus within the receptive field of
	a cortical neuron, two distinct changes can occur: The firing rate
	of the neuron can change and there can be an increase in the coherence
	between spikes and the local field potential (LFP) in the gamma-frequency
	range (30Â–50 Hz). The hypothesis explored here is that these observed
	effects of attention could be a consequence of changes in the synchrony
	of local interneuron networks. We performed computer simulations
	of a Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron driven by a constant depolarizing
	current, I, representing visual stimulation and a modulatory inhibitory
	input representing the effects of attention via local interneuron
	networks. We observed that the neuron's firing rate and the coherence
	of its output spike train with the synaptic inputs was modulated
	by the degree of synchrony of the inhibitory inputs. When inhibitory
	synchrony increased, the coherence of spiking model neurons with
	the synaptic input increased, but the firing rate either increased
	or remained the same. The mean number of synchronous inhibitory inputs
	was a key determinant of the shape of the firing rate versus current
	(fÂ–I) curves. For a large number of inhibitory inputs (50), the
	fÂ–I curve saturated for large I and an increase in input synchrony
	resulted in a shift of sensitivityÂ—the model neuron responded to
	weaker inputs I. For a small number (10), the fÂ–I curves were non-saturating
	and an increase in input synchrony led to an increase in the gain
	of the responseÂ—the firing rate in response to the same input was
	multiplied by an approximately constant factor. The firing rate modulation
	with inhibitory synchrony was highest when the input network oscillated
	in the gamma frequency range. Thus, the observed changes in firing
	rate and coherence of neurons in the visual cortex could be controlled
	by top-down inputs that regulated the coherence in the activity of
	a local inhibitory network discharging at gamma frequencies.},

  abstract = {Multiple factors simultaneously affect the spiking activity of individual
	
	neurons. Determining the effects and relative importance of these
	
	factors is a challenging problem in neurophysiology. We propose a
	
	statistical framework based on the point process likelihood function
	
	to relate a neuron's spiking probability to three typical covariates:
	
	the neuron's own spiking history, concurrent ensemble activity, and
	
	extrinsic covariates such as stimuli or behavior. The framework uses
	
	parametric models of the conditional intensity function to define
	
	a neuron's spiking probability in terms of the covariates. The discrete
	
	time likelihood function for point processes is used to carry out
	
	model fitting and model analysis. We show that, by modeling the logarithm
	
	of the conditional intensity function as a linear combination of
	
	functions of the covariates, the discrete time point process likelihood
	
	function is readily analyzed in the generalized linear model (GLM)
	
	framework. We illustrate our approach for both GLM and non-GLM likelihood
	
	functions using simulated data and multivariate single-unit activity
	
	data simultaneously recorded from the motor cortex of a monkey performing
	
	a visuomotor pursuit-tracking task. The point process framework provides
	
	a flexible, computationally efficient approach for maximum likelihood
	
	estimation, goodness-of-fit assessment, residual analysis, model
	
	selection, and neural decoding. The framework thus allows for the
	
	formulation and analysis of point process models of neural spiking
	
	activity that readily capture the simultaneous effects of multiple
	
	covariates and enables the assessment of their relative importance.},

	has been trapped inside intact mouse and pig lymphocytes, to measure
	
	and manipulate cytoplasmic free {Ca}$^{2+}$ concentrations, [{Ca}$^{2+}$]$_i$.
	
	Quin2 is a tetracarboxylic acid which binds {Ca}$^{2+}$ with 1:1
	
	stoichiometry and an effective dissociation constant of 115 nM in
	
	a cationic background mimicking cytoplasm. Its fluorescence signal
	
	(excitation 339 nm, emission 492 nm) increases about fivefold going
	
	from Ca-free to CA-saturated forms. Cells are loaded with quin2 by
	
	incubation with its acetoxymethyl ester, which readily permeates
	
	the membrane and is hydrolyzed in the cytoplasm, thus trapping the
	
	impermeant quin2 there. The intracellular quin2 appears to be free
	
	in cytoplasm, not bound to membranes and not sequestered inside organelles.
	
	The fluorescence signal from resting cells indicates a [{Ca}$^{2+}$]$_i$
	
	of near 120 nM. The millimolar loadings of quin2 needed for accurately
	
	calibrated signals do not seem to perturb steady-state [{Ca}$^{2+}$]$_i$,
	
	but do somewhat slow or blunt [{Ca}$^{2+}$]$_i$ transients. Loadings
	
	of up to 2mM are without serious toxic effects, though above this
	
	level some lowering of cellular ATP is observed. [{Ca}$^{2+}$]$_i$
	
	was well stabilized in the face of large changes in external {Ca}$^{2+}$.
	
	Alterations of Na+ gradients, membrane potential, or intracellular
	
	pH had little effect. Mitochondrial poisons produced a small increase
	
	in [{Ca}$^{2+}$]$_i$, probably due mostly to the effects of severe
	
	ATP depletion on the plasma membrane. Thus intracellulary trapped
	
	chelators like quin2 offer a method to measure or buffer [{Ca}$^{2+}$]$_i$
	
	in hitherto intractable cell types.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a computational paradigm called Data Driven M
	arkov Chain Monte Carlo (DDMCMC) for image segmentation in the Bayesian
	statistical framework. The paper contrubutes to image segmentation
	in three aspects. Firstly, it designs effective and well balanced
	Markov Chain dynamics to explore the solution space and makes the
	split and merge process reversible at a middle level vision formulation.
	Thus it achieves globally optimal solution independent of initial
	segmentations. Secondly, instead of computing a single maximum a
	posteriori solution, it proposes a mathematical principle for computing
	multiple distinct solutions to incorporate intrinsic ambiguities
	in image segmentation. A k-adventurers algorithm is proposed for
	extracting distinct multiple solutions from the Markov chain sequence.
	Thirdly, it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) techniques, such as
	clustering and edge detection, to compute importance proposal probabilities,
	which effectively drive the Markov chain dynamics and achieve tremendous
	speedup in comparison to traditional jump-diffusion method [4]. Thus
	DDMCMC paradigm provides a unifying framework where the role of existing
	segmentation algorithms, such as, edge detection, clustering, region
	growing, split-,erge, SNAKEs, region competition, are revealed as
	either realizing Markov chain dynamics or computing importance proposal

	The technique, called q-ball imaging, can resolve intravoxel white

	92: 780Â–789, 2004; 10.1152/jn.01171.2003. Recent studies have revealed
	striking precision in the spike trains of retinal ganglion cells
	in several species and suggested that this precision could be an
	important aspect of visual signaling. However, the precision of spike
	trains has not yet been described in primate retina. The spike time
	and count variability of parasol (magnocellular-projecting) retinal
	ganglion cells was examined in isolated macaque monkey retinas stimulated
	with repeated presentations of high contrast, spatially uniform intensity
	modulation. At the onset of clearly delineated periods of firing,
	retinal ganglion cells fired spikes time-locked to the stimulus with
	a variability across trials as low as 1 ms. Spike count variance
	across trials was much lower than the mean and sometimes approached
	the minimum variance possible with discrete counts, inconsistent
	with Poisson statistics expected from independently generated spikes.
	Spike time and count variability decreased systematically with stimulus
	strength. These findings were consistent with a model in which firing
	probability was determined by a stimulus-driven free firing rate
	modulated by a recovery function representing the action potential
	absolute and relative refractory period.},

	stimulation of the ipsilateral lateral lemniscus (LL) or the commissure

	at a depolarized holding potential. In addition, deafness caused
	
	a decrease in excitatory neurotransmitter release at the LL pathway,

	a postsynaptic decrease in IPSC conductance, a 25-mV depolarization
	
	in the IPSC equilibrium potential and a decrease of neurotransmitter

	The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations

	the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose
	of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete

	Embryos exposed to nicotine become functionally paralyzed by 42 hpf

	their axons made pathfinding errors (Svoboda, K.R., Vijayaraghaven,

	development caused by nicotine exposure could play in contributing
	to the errors in spinal motoneuron axon pathfinding. In this study,
	we show that an alteration in skeletal muscle development occurs
	in tandem with alterations in spinal motoneuron development upon
	exposure to nicotine. The alteration in the muscle involves the binding
	of nicotine to the muscle-specific AChRs. The nicotine-induced alteration
	in muscle development does not occur in the zebrafish mutant (sofa
	potato, [sop]), which lacks muscle-specific AChRs. Even though muscle
	development is unaffected by nicotine exposure in sop mutants, motoneuron
	axonal pathfinding errors still occur in these mutants, indicating
	a direct effect of nicotine exposure on nervous system development.},

	those in the lower part of the body are innervated by a set of motor
	neurones in a longitudinal fibre bundle which joins the nerve ring,
	the ventral cord. These motor neurones can be put into five classes

	junctions. Members of a given class are arranged in a regular linear
	sequence in the cord and have non-overlapping fields of motor synaptic
	activity, the transition between fields of adjacent neurones being
	sharp and well defined. Members of a given class form gap junctions

  note = {The paper analyses bounds on spatial resolution of EEGs. Localization
	bounds derived turn out to be 1-5mm.},
  abstract = {Background: The electroencephalogram (EEG) reflects the electrical
	activity in the brain on the surface of scalp. A major challenge
	in this field is the localization of sources in the brain responsible
	for eliciting the EEG signal measured at the scalp. In order to estimate
	the location of these sources, one must correctly model the sources,
	i.e., dipoles, as well as the volume conductor in which the resulting
	currents flow. In this study, we investigate the effects of dipole
	depth and orientation on source localization with varying sets of
	simulated random noise in 4 realistic head models. Methods: Dipole
	simulations were performed using realistic head models and using
	the boundary element method (BEM). In all, 92 dipole locations placed
	in temporal and parietal regions of the head with varying depth and
	orientation were investigated along with 6 different levels of simulated
	random noise. Localization errors due to dipole depth, orientation
	and noise were investigated. Results: The results indicate that there
	are no significant differences in localization error due tangential
	and radial dipoles. With high levels of simulated Gaussian noise,
	localization errors are depth-dependant. For low levels of added
	noise, errors are similar for both deep and superficial sources.
	Conclusion: It was found that if the signal-to-noise ratio is above
	a certain threshold, localization errors in realistic head models
	are, on average the same for deep and superficial sources. As the

  abstract = {To understand how auditory information is processed in the cochlear
	
	nuclei, it is crucial to know what circuitry exists and how it functions.
	
	Previous anatomical experiments have shown that neurons in the deep
	
	layer of the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) project topographically
	
	to the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) (Wickesberg and Oertel,
	
	1988). Because interneurons in the DCN and their targets in AVCN
	
	are excited by the same group of auditory nerve fibers, the projection
	
	is frequency-specific. Here we report that microinjections of glutamate
	
	in the DCN evoke trains of IPSPs in individual, impaled AVCN neurons
	
	in brain slices of the cochlear nuclear complex. Only injections
	
	along a rostrocaudal band in the DCN, matching the anatomical projection
	
	of tuberculoventral neurons, evoke IPSPs; elsewhere, there were no
	
	responses to the glutamate. The inhibition is blocked by 0.5 microM
	
	strychnine. Both bushy and stellate cells are targets of the inhibitory
	
	projection. Inhibition in the AVCN is delayed by an additional synaptic
	
	delay with respect to the excitation. Delayed, frequency-specific
	
	inhibition allows the first wavefront to be transmitted to higher
	
	auditory centers by bushy and stellate cells, while following inputs
	
	encoding signals of similar frequencies are attenuated at least for
	
	the duration of an IPSP. These findings are consistent with results
	
	from psychoacoustic experiments and suggest that this circuit provides
	
	a source of monaural echo suppression.},

  abstract = {In this paper strong limits on the accuracy of real-world physical
	computation are established. To derive these results a non-Turing
	machine formulation of physical computation is used. First it is
	proven that there cannot be a physical computer C to which one can
	pose any and all computational tasks concerning the physical universe.
	Next it is proven that no physical computer C can correctly carry
	out every computational task in the subset of such tasks that could
	potentially be posed to C. This means in particular that there cannot
	be a physical computer that can be assured of correctly "processing
	information faster than the universe does." Because this result holds
	independent of how or if the computer is physically coupled to the
	rest of the universe, it also means that there cannot exist an infallible,
	general-purpose observation apparatus, nor an infallible, general-purpose
	control apparatus. These results do not rely on systems that are
	infinite, and/or nonclassical, and/or obey chaotic dynamics. They
	also hold even if one could use an infinitely fast, infinitely dense
	computer, with computational powers greater than that of a Turing
	machine (TM). After deriving these results analogs of the TM Halting
	theorem are derived for the novel kind of computer considered in
	this paper, as are results concerning the (im)possibility of certain
	kinds of error-correcting codes. In addition, an analog of algorithmic
	information complexity, "prediction complexity," is elaborated. A
	task-independent bound is derived on how much the prediction complexity
	of a computational task can differ for two different reference universal
	physical computers used to solve that task. This is analogous to
	the "encoding" bound governing how much the algorithm information
	complexity of a TM calculation can differ for two reference universal
	TMs. It is proven that either the Hamiltonian of our universe proscribes
	a certain type of computation, or prediction complexity is unique
	(unlike algorithmic information complexity). Finally, the implications
	of this analysis for the issue of whether the universe "is" a computer
	are briefly discussed.},

  journal = {The astrophysical journal},
  year = {2001},
  volume = {555},
  pages = {504},
  abstract = {Strong lensing is a powerful probe of the distribution of matter in
	the cores of clusters of galaxies. Recent studies suggest that the
	cold dark matter model predicts cores that are denser than those
	observed in galaxies, groups, and clusters. One possible resolution
	of the discrepancy is that the dark matter has strong interactions
	(SIDM), which leads to lower central densities. A generalized form
	of the Navarro, Frenk, & White profile (Zhao profile) can be used
	to describe these halos. In this paper we examine gravitational lensing
	statistics for this class of model. The optical depth to multiple
	imaging is a very sensitive function of the profile parameters in
	the range of interest for SIDM halos around clusters of galaxies.
	Less concentrated profiles, which result from larger self-interaction
	cross sections, can produce many fewer lensed pairs. Furthermore,
	profiles that result in a small optical depth exhibit reduced typical
	splittings, but produce multiple images that are more highly magnified.
	However, the resulting increased magnification bias does not alter
	our conclusions. We find that lensing statistics based on profile
	parameters obtained from fits out to the virial radius are dependent

	However, profile fits weighted toward the core region have parameter
	degeneracies that are approximately equivalent to those for strong-lensing
	cross sections. Lensing statistics provide a powerful test for SIDM.
	More realistic and observationally oriented calculations remain to
	be done; however, larger self-interaction cross sections may well
	be ruled out by the very existence of strong lenses on galaxy cluster
	scales. The inclusion of centrally dominant cluster galaxies should
	boost the cross section to multiple imaging. However, our preliminary
	calculations suggest that the additional multiple imaging rate is
	small with respect to the differences in multiple imaging rate for
	different halo profiles. In future statistical studies, it will be
	important to properly account for the scatter among halo profiles,
	since the optical depth to multiple imaging is dominated by the most
	concentrated members of a cluster population.},

  abstract = {Odors are initially represented in the olfactory bulb (OB) by patterns
	
	of sensory input across the array of glomeruli. Although activated
	
	glomeruli are often widely distributed, glomeruli responding to stimuli
	
	sharing molecular features tend to be loosely clustered and thus
	
	establish a fractured chemotopic map. Neuronal circuits in the OB
	
	transform glomerular patterns of sensory input into spatiotemporal
	
	patterns of output activity and thereby extract information about
	
	a stimulus. It is, however, unknown whether the chemotopic spatial
	
	organization of glomerular inputs is maintained during these computations.
	
	To explore this issue, we measured spatiotemporal patterns of odor-evoked
	
	activity across thousands of individual neurons in the zebrafish
	
	OB by temporally deconvolved two-photon {Ca}$^{2+}$ imaging. Mitral
	
	cells and interneurons were distinguished by transgenic markers and
	
	exhibited different response selectivities. Shortly after response
	
	onset, activity patterns exhibited foci of activity associated with
	
	certain chemical features throughout all layers. During the subsequent
	
	few hundred milliseconds, however, MC activity was locally sparsened
	
	within the initial foci in an odor-specific manner. As a consequence,
	
	chemotopic maps disappeared and activity patterns became more informative
	
	about precise odor identity. Hence, chemotopic maps of glomerular
	
	input activity are initially transmitted to OB outputs, but not maintained
	
	during pattern processing. Nevertheless, transient chemotopic maps
	
	may support neuronal computations by establishing important synaptic
	
	interactions within the circuit. These results provide insights into
	
	the functional topology of neural activity patterns and its potential
	
	role in circuit function.},

	The beta function in the broken phase becomes neg- ative and the

	value varies with the renormalization prescriptions, a detail which
	is different from the asymptotic free solution in the one loop case.
	The symmetry breaking phase is shown to be an entirely strong-coupling
	phase. The reason of the relevance of the renormalization prescriptions
	is shown to be due to the nonperturbative nature of the effective

	morphometric analysis was performed with the automated segmentation
	work-flow implemented in FreeSurfer. Genetic analysis of the APOE
	genotype was determined with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on DNA
	from whole-blood. All individuals were subjected to extensive neuropsychological
	testing, including the California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT).
	To obtain robust and easily interpretable relationships between explanatory
	variables and verbal memory function we applied the recent method
	of conditional inference trees in addition to scatterplot matrices
	and simple pairwise linear least-squares regression analysis.RESULTS:APOE
	genotype had no significant impact on the CVLT results (scores on
	long delay free recall, CVLT-LD) or the ICV-normalized hippocampal
	volumes. Hippocampal volumes were found to decrease with age and
	a right-larger-than-left hippocampal asymmetry was also found. These
	findings are in accordance with previous studies. CVLT-LD score was
	shown to correlate with hippocampal volume. Multivariate conditional
	inference analysis showed that gender and left hippocampal volume
	largely dominated predictive values for CVLT-LD scores in our sample.
	Left hippocampal volume dominated predictive values for females but
	not for males. APOE genotype did not alter the model significantly,
	and age was only partly influencing the results.CONCLUSION:Gender
	and left hippocampal volumes are main predictors for verbal memory
	function in normal aging. APOE genotype did not affect the results
	in any part of our analysis.},

  abstract = {Most excitatory synaptic connections occur on dendritic spines. Calcium
	
	imaging experiments have suggested that spines constitute individual
	
	calcium compartments, but recent results have challenged this idea.
	
	Using two-photon microscopy to image fluorescence with high resolution
	
	in strongly scattering tissue, we measured calcium dynamics in spines
	
	from CA1 pyramidal neurons in slices of rat hippocampus. Subthreshold
	
	synaptic stimulation and spontaneous synaptic events produced calcium
	
	accumulations that were localized to isolated spines, showed stochastic
	
	failure, and were abolished by postsynaptic blockers. Single somatic
	
	spikes induced fast-peaking calcium accumulation in spines throughout
	
	the cell. Pairing of spikes with synaptic stimulation was frequently
	
	cooperative, that is, it resulted in supralinear calcium accumulations.
	
	We conclude: (1) calcium channels exist in spine heads; (2) action
	
	potentials invade the spines; (3) spines are individual calcium compartments;
	
	and (4) spines can individually detect the temporal coincidence of
	
	pre- and postsynaptic activity, and thus serve as basic functional
	
	units of neuronal integration.},

	receptor activation, even with low-frequency stimulation. The inhibitory
	neurotransmitter GABA also increased [Ca2+]i, probably via voltage-sensitive
	Ca2+ channels, whereas the neuromodulator acetylcholine caused Ca2+
	release from intracellular stores via a muscarinic receptor. Low
	concentrations of these agonists produced nonperiodic [Ca2+]i oscillations,
