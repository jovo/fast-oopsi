We assume a simple discrete-time state-space model relating spikes, $n_t$, baseline subtracted intracellular calcium concentration, denoted by $C_t$, and fluorescence measurements, $F_t$.  First, we assume a linear relationship between $F_t$ and $C_t$, with gaussian noise.  Second, we assume that $C_t$ jumps after each spike, and then decays according to some time constant.  Finally, we assume that spikes are distributed according to a Poisson process. The above assumptions lead to the follwoing model:

%. (1) spikes follow Poisson statistics with rate $\lam \Del$, (2) $C_t$ decays exponentially with decay $\gamma$ to baseline $\nu$, but jumps by $\rho$ after each spike, and (3) fluorescent observations are linear functions of $C_t$ with additive Gaussian noise with variance $\sig^2$.  Together, these assumptions imply the following model:

\begin{align}
\bF_t &= \balpha (C_t + \beta) +  \ve{\varepsilon}_t, \qquad &\ve{\varepsilon}_t \sim \mathcal{N}(\ve{0},\sig^2 \bI) \label{eq:obs} \\
C_t  &= \gamma  C_{t-1} + n_t,  \qquad &n_t \sim \text{Poisson}(n_t; \lam \Del) \label{eq:trans}  
\end{align}

\noindent where $\balpha$ and $\beta$ set the fluorescence spatial filter and offset respectively, $\sig^2$ indicates the variance of the noise, and $\gamma$ sets the decay rate. %Note that   . To enforce identifiability, we will let $\balpha=1$ and $\beta=0$, without loss of generality, as explained below.
